# Module 3: Boolean Algebra

**Duration**: Weeks 8-10

## Core Topics

### Boolean Functions (Week 8)

- Truth tables
- Basic operations: AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR
- Boolean laws and duality
- Normal forms: DNF and CNF
- Perfect normal forms

### Digital Circuits (Week 9)

- Logic gates
- Circuit design and analysis
- Multi-level circuits
- Functional completeness
- Universal gates (NAND, NOR)

### Minimization (Week 10)

- Karnaugh maps (K-maps)
- Don't care conditions
- Quine-McCluskey algorithm
- Prime implicants

## Key Concepts

**Boolean Function**: f: {0,1}ⁿ → {0,1}

**Normal Forms**:

- **DNF**: Sum of products (OR of ANDs)
- **CNF**: Product of sums (AND of ORs)

**Functionally Complete**: A set of operations that can express any Boolean function

- Examples: {AND, OR, NOT}, {NAND}, {NOR}

**K-Map**: Visual method for minimizing Boolean expressions (works well for ≤4 variables)

## Applications

- Digital circuit design
- Computer hardware architecture
- Compiler optimization
- SAT solvers

## What You'll Be Able To Do

- Construct truth tables for Boolean expressions
- Convert between DNF, CNF, and arbitrary forms
- Simplify expressions using Boolean laws
- Design circuits using logic gates
- Minimize functions with K-maps
- Prove functional completeness
