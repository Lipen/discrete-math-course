- ✓ **CS foundations** -- Build groundwork for algorithms, theory, and beyond

## 📋 Course Policies

### Attendance

- **Lectures**: Mandatory -- Material covered is essential for success
- **Tests & Colloquiums**: Attendance required on scheduled dates
- **Defenses**: Missing homework defense = zero score

### Academic Integrity

| Assessment | Collaboration Policy |
|------------|---------------------|
| **Homework** | Discussion encouraged, write solutions independently |
| **Tests** | Individual work only, open book |
| **Colloquiums (TMs)** | Individual work only, closed book |
| **Final Exam** | Individual work only |

> **⚠️ Plagiarism**: Results in zero score, potential course failure, and academic misconduct report.

### Communication

| Channel | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| ☎️ **Telegram** | Announcements, quick questions, discussions |
| 🐙 **GitHub** | Course materials, issue tracker |
| 🎓 **Mentors** | Help sessions, homework guidance |

## 📚 Course Materials

### Primary Resources

- **Lecture Notes** -- Slides and PDFs for each module
- **Homework Assignments** -- Practice problems with solutions
- **Cheatsheets** -- Quick reference for key concepts

### Recommended Textbooks

| Book | Author | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| *Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications* | Kenneth Rosen | Comprehensive reference |
| *Discrete Mathematics with Applications* | Susanna Epp | Clear explanations |
| *Book of Proof* | Richard Hammack | Excellent for proofs |

## 💡 Important Notes

> **⚠️ This course requires consistent effort throughout both semesters.**
>
> Discrete mathematics builds concepts cumulatively -- missing lectures or falling behind makes catching up extremely difficult.

**Key Points:**

- Proof writing develops over time -- expect initial difficulty
- Start homework early
- Use Telegram and mentors for questions
