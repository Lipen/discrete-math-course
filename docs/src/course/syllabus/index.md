## Important Notes

> **This course requires consistent effort throughout the semester.** Discrete mathematics builds concepts cumulativelyâ€”missing lectures or falling behind makes catching up difficult.

Mathematical proof writing is a skill that develops over time. Expect initial difficulty, but persistence leads to mastery.

**Success requires active engagement with the material, not just memorization of formulas.**
