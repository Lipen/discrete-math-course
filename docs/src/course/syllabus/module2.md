# Module 2: Binary Relations

**Duration**: Weeks 3-7

## Core Topics

### Properties of Relations

- Reflexive, irreflexive
- Symmetric, antisymmetric, asymmetric
- Transitive
- Composition and closures

### Equivalence Relations (Weeks 3-4)

- Definition and properties
- Equivalence classes
- Partitions and quotient sets
- Fundamental theorem: equivalence ↔ partition

### Order Relations (Weeks 4-5)

- Partial orders (posets)
- Linear (total) orders
- Well-orderings
- Hasse diagrams
- Maximal/minimal, greatest/least elements
- Chains and antichains
- Dilworth's theorem

### Functions (Week 5)

- Functions as special relations
- Domain, codomain, range, image, preimage
- Injective (one-to-one)
- Surjective (onto)
- Bijective (one-to-one correspondence)
- Composition and inverses
- Pigeonhole principle

### Lattices (Week 7)

- Meets (∧) and joins (∨)
- Complete lattices
- Modular and distributive lattices
- Boolean algebras as lattices

## Key Concepts

**Equivalence Relation**: Reflexive + Symmetric + Transitive

**Partial Order**: Reflexive + Antisymmetric + Transitive

**Function**: Relation where each input has exactly one output

**Bijection**: Function that is both injective and surjective

## Applications

- Database design and normalization
- Program analysis and verification
- Scheduling problems
- Cryptography

## What You'll Be Able To Do

- Determine properties of given relations
- Find equivalence classes and quotient sets
- Draw and interpret Hasse diagrams
- Prove functions are injective/surjective/bijective
- Compose functions and find inverses
- Apply pigeonhole principle to counting problems
