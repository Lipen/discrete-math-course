# 🔗 Module 2: Binary Relations

**Duration**: Weeks 3-7

## 📚 Core Topics

### Properties of Relations

- **Reflexive & Irreflexive**: Self-relationships
- **Symmetric, Antisymmetric & Asymmetric**: Bidirectional behavior
- **Transitive**: Chain relationships
- **Composition & Closures**: Building new relations

### Equivalence Relations (Weeks 3-4)

- Definition and properties
- Equivalence classes
- Partitions and quotient sets
- **Fundamental theorem**: Equivalences <-> Partitions

### Order Relations (Weeks 4-5)

- **Partial Orders (Posets)**: ≤ relation
- **Linear/Total Orders**: Complete ordering
- **Well-orderings**: Every subset has minimum
- **Hasse Diagrams**: Visual representation
- **Elements**: Maximal/minimal, greatest/least
- **Structures**: Chains and antichains
- **Dilworth's Theorem**: Chain decomposition

### Functions (Week 5)

- Functions as special relations
- **Components**: Domain, codomain, range, image, preimage
- **Types**:
  - Injective (one-to-one)
  - Surjective (onto)
  - Bijective: Both injective and surjective
- Composition and inverses

### Lattices (Week 7)

- Upper and lower bounds
- Suprema and infima
- Complete lattices
- Modular and distributive lattices
- Boolean algebras as lattices

## 🔑 Key Definitions

| Relation Type | Properties | Example |
|--------------|------------|---------|
| **Equivalence** | Reflexive + Symmetric + Transitive | Equality, Congruence |
| **Partial Order** | Reflexive + Antisymmetric + Transitive | Divisibility, Subset |
| **Total Order** | Partial Order + Any two comparable | ≤ on ℝ |
| **Function** | Each input maps to exactly one output | f: ℕ → ℕ, f(n) = n² |
