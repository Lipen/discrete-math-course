# Module 1: Set Theory

**Duration**: Weeks 1-2 + Week 6

## Core Topics

### Weeks 1-2: Foundations

- Set operations (∪, ∩, \, ⊕, complement)
- Power sets and Boolean algebra of sets
- Venn diagrams
- Cartesian products
- Russell's paradox
- Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms (ZFC)
- Axiom of choice

### Week 6: Cardinality

- Finite vs infinite sets
- Countable and uncountable sets
- Pairing functions and encodings
- Cantor's diagonal argument
- Cantor's theorem: |A| < |𝒫(A)|
- Schroeder-Bernstein theorem
- Hilbert's hotel paradox

## Key Concepts

**Set Operations**: Union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference, complement

**Power Set**: 𝒫(A) = set of all subsets of A. If |A| = n, then |𝒫(A)| = 2ⁿ

**Cardinality**:

- Finite: |A| = n for some n ∈ ℕ
- Countable: |A| = |ℕ| (e.g., integers, rationals)
- Uncountable: |A| > |ℕ| (e.g., real numbers)

## Applications

- Database theory and relational algebra
- Probability theory foundations
- Formal language theory

## What You'll Be Able To Do

- Prove set identities using element arguments or algebraic laws
- Construct Venn diagrams for complex expressions
- Determine cardinality of finite and infinite sets
- Prove sets are countable or uncountable
- Apply Cantor's diagonal argument
