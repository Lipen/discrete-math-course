# Module 4: Formal Logic

**Duration**: Weeks 11-16

## Core Topics

### Propositional Logic (Weeks 11-12)

- Syntax: formulas, atoms, connectives
- Semantics: truth tables, models
- Tautologies, contradictions, satisfiability
- Logical equivalence and consequence
- Natural deduction proof system

### Metalogic (Week 12)

- Soundness theorem
- Completeness theorem
- Compactness theorem
- Decidability

### Predicate Logic (Week 13)

- Syntax: predicates, quantifiers (∀, ∃), terms
- Bound and free variables
- Interpretations and models
- Prenex normal form
- Gödel's completeness theorem (overview)
- Gödel's incompleteness theorems (overview)

### Categorical Logic (Week 14)

- A, E, I, O statements
- Traditional square of opposition
- Categorical syllogisms
- Validity analysis
- Venn diagram methods

## Key Concepts

**Tautology**: Formula true in all interpretations (e.g., P ∨ ¬P)

**Logical Consequence**: Γ ⊨ φ means φ is true in all models where all formulas in Γ are true

**Soundness**: If provable, then valid (⊢ implies ⊨)

**Completeness**: If valid, then provable (⊨ implies ⊢)

**Quantifiers**:

- **∀x P(x)**: "For all x, P(x) holds"
- **∃x P(x)**: "There exists x such that P(x) holds"

## Applications

- Automated theorem proving
- Program verification
- Database query languages
- Knowledge representation
- Formal methods in software engineering

## What You'll Be Able To Do

- Determine if formulas are tautologies/contradictions
- Construct natural deduction proofs
- Show logical equivalence
- Translate between natural and formal languages
- Work with quantifiers
- Analyze validity of syllogisms
