## üéØ What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

**üçÅ Fall Semester:**

- Work confidently with sets, operations, and cardinality
- Understand and apply binary relations (equivalence, order, functions)
- Design and analyze Boolean expressions and digital circuits
- Construct formal proofs using natural deduction

**üå± Spring Semester:**

- Analyze graphs and trees using various algorithms
- Solve network flow problems
- Design and analyze finite automata and regular languages
- Apply combinatorial principles and generating functions

## üìö Course Structure

**Two-semester course covering 8 "modules":**

**üçÅ Fall Semester:**

- **Set Theory** (Weeks 1--2, 6)
   Sets, operations, cardinality, axioms

- **Binary Relations** (Weeks 3--7)
   Equivalence, order, functions, lattices

- **Boolean Algebra** (Weeks 8--10)
   Logic gates, circuits, minimization

- **Formal Logic** (Weeks 11--16)
   Propositional and predicate logic, proofs

**üå± Spring Semester:**

- **Graph Theory** (Weeks 1--4)
    Graphs, trees, paths, cycles, algorithms

- **Flow Networks** (Week 5)
    Max flow, min cut, applications

- **Automata Theory** (Weeks 6--10)
    Finite automata, regular languages, NFAs

- **Combinatorics** (Weeks 11--16)
    Counting principles, generating functions, recurrences

## üìä Assessment Overview

In each semester, you will complete:

| Component | Count | Points Each | Total |
|-----------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Homework | 4 | 10 | 40 |
| Tests | 4 | 5 | 20 |
| Theoretical Minimums | 2 | 10 | 20 |
| Final Exam | 1 | 20 | 20 |
| **Total** | | | **100** |

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: You must complete all homework and pass all Theoretical Minimums to receive a passing grade, regardless of total points.

## üéì Key Success Factors

- **Attend all lectures** - Material builds cumulatively
- **Start homework early** - Give yourself time to think and iterate
- **Form study groups** - Explain concepts to each other
- **Practice regularly** - Mathematical skill develops through repetition
- **Ask questions** - Use mentors and Telegram group actively
