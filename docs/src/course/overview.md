| **Semester** | Fall 2025 |
| **Credits** | 6 ECTS |
| **Prerequisites** | High school mathematics |
| **Language** | Russian (lectures), English (materials) |
| **Instructor** | Konstantin Chukharev |

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Work confidently with sets, operations, and cardinality
- Understand and apply binary relations (equivalence, order, functions)
- Design and analyze Boolean expressions and digital circuits
- Construct formal proofs using natural deduction
- Apply discrete math concepts to computer science problems

## Course Structure

The course has **4 main modules**:

1. **Set Theory** (Weeks 1-2, 6) - Sets, operations, cardinality, axioms
2. **Binary Relations** (Weeks 3-7) - Equivalence, order, functions, lattices
3. **Boolean Algebra** (Weeks 8-10) - Logic gates, circuits, minimization
4. **Formal Logic** (Weeks 11-16) - Propositional and predicate logic, proofs

## Assessment Overview

| Component | Count | Points Each | Total |
|-----------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Homework | 4 | 10 | 40 |
| Tests | 4 | 5 | 20 |
| Theoretical Minimums | 2 | 10 | 20 |
| Final Exam | 1 | 20 | 20 |
| **Total** | | | **100** |

**Important**: You must complete all homework and pass both Theoretical Minimums to receive a passing grade, regardless of total points.

## Key Success Factors

- **Attend all lectures** - material builds cumulatively
- **Start homework early** - give yourself time to think
- **Form study groups** - explain concepts to each other
- **Practice regularly** - mathematical skill develops through repetition
- **Ask questions** - use office hours and Telegram
