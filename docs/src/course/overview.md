- Understand and apply binary relations (equivalence, order, functions)
- Design and analyze Boolean expressions and digital circuits
- Construct formal proofs using natural deduction
- Apply discrete math concepts to computer science problems

## 📚 Course Structure

The course has **4 main modules**:

1. **Set Theory** (Weeks 1-2, 6)
Sets, operations, cardinality, axioms

2. **Binary Relations** (Weeks 3-7)
Equivalence, order, functions, lattices

3. **Boolean Algebra** (Weeks 8-10)
Logic gates, circuits, minimization

4. **Formal Logic** (Weeks 11-16)
Propositional and predicate logic, proofs

## 📊 Assessment Overview

| Component | Count | Points Each | Total |
|-----------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Homework | 4 | 10 | 40 |
| Tests | 4 | 5 | 20 |
| Theoretical Minimums | 2 | 10 | 20 |
| Final Exam | 1 | 20 | 20 |
| **Total** | | | **100** |

> **⚠️ Important**: You must complete all homework and pass both Theoretical Minimums to receive a passing grade, regardless of total points.

## 🎓 Key Success Factors

- **Attend all lectures** - Material builds cumulatively
- **Start homework early** - Give yourself time to think and iterate
- **Form study groups** - Explain concepts to each other
- **Practice regularly** - Mathematical skill develops through repetition
- **Ask questions** - Use mentors and Telegram group actively
