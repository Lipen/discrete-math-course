# Getting Help

## 💬 Telegram Group

**Main Communication Channel**

The Telegram group is our primary platform for:

- 📢 Course announcements and updates
- ❓ Quick questions and clarifications
- 💡 Discussion of concepts and approaches
- 👥 Finding study partners
- 📅 Schedule changes and reminders

> **Link**: Provided in class or by instructor

### Guidelines

- ✅ Ask conceptual questions, discuss problem-solving strategies
- ✅ Help classmates understand concepts
- ✅ Search chat history before asking repeated questions
- ❌ Don't share complete homework solutions
- ❌ Don't ask for answers without showing your work

## 🎓 Mentors & Office Hours

**When to Seek Help**:

- Understanding homework problems
- Clarifying lecture material
- Reviewing proof techniques
- Preparing for exams
- Getting feedback on your approach

**What Mentors Can Do**:

- Explain concepts in different ways
- Point you in the right direction
- Help debug your reasoning
- Suggest practice problems
- Review your proof strategy

**What Mentors Won't Do**:

- Solve homework for you
- Give you exam answers
- Write proofs for you

> **Contact**: Via Telegram group or scheduled office hours

## 👥 Study Groups

### Why Study Groups Work

- Explain concepts to solidify understanding
- Learn different problem-solving approaches
- Stay motivated and accountable
- Practice mathematical communication
- Catch each other's mistakes

### Finding Study Partners

1. Post in Telegram: "Looking for study group for Module X"
2. Connect with classmates after lectures
3. Form groups of 3--5 students

### Running Effective Sessions

**Good practices:**

- Schedule regular meetings (2--3 times per week before deadlines)
- Work through problems together on a whiteboard
- Take turns explaining solutions
- Quiz each other on definitions
- Prepare individually before meeting

**Avoid:**

- Just copying each other's work
- Letting one person do all the explaining
- Only socializing without studying
- Meeting only right before deadlines

> **Remember**: See [Academic Integrity](../course/grading/policies.md) for collaboration rules

## ❓ How to Ask Good Questions

### Effective Question Structure

**❌ Ineffective**: "I don't understand Cantor's theorem."

**✅ Effective**: "I understand that Cantor's theorem proves \\(|A| < |\mathcal{P}(A)|\\), but I'm confused about why the diagonal argument works. Specifically, how does constructing a set \\(S\\) that differs from every set in the supposed surjection lead to a contradiction?"

### Include

1. **What you know**: Show your current understanding
2. **What you tried**: Explain your attempts
3. **Where you're stuck**: Pinpoint the specific confusion
4. **Relevant context**: Problem statement, theorem, concept

### Homework Question Guidelines

| Allowed | Not Allowed |
|---------|-------------|
| "Can you explain what 'reflexive' means?" | "What's the answer to problem 3?" |
| "Is this approach correct: ..." | "Can you solve this for me?" |
| "How do I start this type of problem?" | "What's the full solution?" |
| "Can you check if my proof strategy works?" | "Can you write the proof?" |
