## 📚 Coverage

### 📐 Set Theory (Weeks 1--2, 6)

- Cartesian products
- Russell's paradox
- Axiomatic set theory (ZFC)
- Cantor's diagonalization
- Schroeder-Bernstein theorem

### 🔗 Binary Relations (Weeks 3--7)

- Relation properties (reflexive, symmetric, transitive, antisymmetric)
- Equivalence relations and partitions
- Order relations and Hasse diagrams
- Functions (injection, surjection, bijection)
- Composition and inverses (\\((g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x))\\))
- Lattices

## 📝 Sample Questions

### Definitions

- Define equivalence relation (with example)
- What is a well-ordering?
- Define power set and its cardinality
- Define bijection
- What is a partition?

### Theorems

- State equivalence-partition correspondence theorem
- State Cantor's theorem
- State Schroeder-Bernstein theorem
- Composition associativity

### Proofs

- Prove \\(\mathbb{R}\\) is uncountable
- Show composition of bijections is bijective

### Conceptual

- Why does Russell's paradox matter?
- Difference between maximal and greatest element?
- Example of injective but not surjective function
- Why is \\(\mathbb{Q}\\) countable but \\(\mathbb{R}\\) not?

## 📖 Preparation Checklist

- [ ] Create flashcards for definitions
- [ ] List all theorem statements
- [ ] Identify 5 hardest concepts

### ✅ Week 7 (1 week before)

- [ ] Practice 10+ proofs without looking
- [ ] Join study group, quiz each other
- [ ] Can recite all definitions precisely?
- [ ] Attend review session

### ✅ Day Before

- [ ] Light review of flashcards
- [ ] Quick skim of theorem statements
- [ ] **Get 8 hours sleep!**
- [ ] Prepare mentally, stay calm

## 💡 Pro Tips

> **🎯 Success Strategy**
>
> - **Definitions first**: If you can't define it, you can't use it
> - **Proof structure matters**: Introduction → Body → Conclusion
> - **Use examples**: Verify your reasoning with concrete cases
> - **Time management**: Don't spend 60 min on one proof
> - **Partial credit**: Write what you know, even if incomplete

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Confusing "injective" and "surjective"
- ❌ Writing "obvious" instead of proving rigorously
- ❌ Circular reasoning in proofs
- ❌ Mixing up \\(\in\\) (element) and \\(\subseteq\\) (subset)
- ❌ Forgetting to check all relation properties

### What Graders Look For

- ✓ Precise definitions (exact wording)
- ✓ Complete proofs (no gaps in logic)
- ✓ Clear explanations (not just symbols)
- ✓ Correct examples and counterexamples
- ✓ Proper mathematical notation
