## 📚 Coverage

The first theoretical minimum covers fundamental concepts from the initial modules of the course:

### 📐 Set Theory (Weeks 1--2, 6)

- Set operations and laws
- Power sets
- Cartesian products
- Russell's paradox
- Axiomatic set theory (ZFC)
- Cardinality
- Countable vs uncountable sets
- Cantor's diagonalization
- Schroeder-Bernstein theorem

### 🔗 Binary Relations (Weeks 3--7)

- Relation properties (reflexive, symmetric, transitive, antisymmetric)
- Equivalence relations and partitions
- Order relations and Hasse diagrams
- Functions (injection, surjection, bijection)
- Composition and inverses
- Lattices

## 📝 Sample Questions

### Definitions

- Define equivalence relation (with example)
- What is a well-ordering?
- Define power set and its cardinality
- Define bijection
- What is a partition?

### Theorems

- State equivalence-partition correspondence theorem
- State Cantor's theorem
- State Schroeder-Bernstein theorem
- Composition associativity

### Proofs

- Prove real numbers are uncountable
- Show composition of bijections is bijective
- Prove every finite poset has maximal element

### Conceptual

- Why does Russell's paradox matter?
- Difference between maximal and greatest element?
- Example of injective but not surjective function
- Why are rationals countable but reals uncountable?

## ✅ What You Must Know

- Set operations (union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference) and laws
- Relation properties (reflexive, symmetric, transitive, antisymmetric)
- Equivalence relations and partitions
- Partial orders, total orders, well-orders
- Injective, surjective, bijective functions
- Composition of relations and functions
- Cardinality (finite, countable, uncountable)
- Key theorems: Cantor's theorem, Schroeder-Bernstein, equivalence-partition correspondence
- Proof techniques: element method, double inclusion, diagonalization

## 📖 Preparation Checklist

### ✅ Week 6 (2 weeks before)

- [ ] Review all lecture notes from Weeks 1--7
- [ ] Create flashcards for definitions
- [ ] List all theorem statements
- [ ] Identify 5 hardest concepts

### ✅ Week 7 (1 week before)

- [ ] Practice 10+ proofs without looking
- [ ] Join study group, quiz each other
- [ ] Can recite all definitions precisely?
- [ ] Attend review session

### ✅ Day Before

- [ ] Light review of materials
- [ ] **Get 8 hours sleep!**
- [ ] Prepare mentally, stay calm

## 💡 Pro Tips

> **🎯 Success Strategy**
>
> - **Definitions first**: If you can't define it, you can't use it
> - **Proof structure matters**: Introduction → Body → Conclusion
> - **Use examples**: Verify your reasoning with concrete cases
> - **Time management**: Don't spend 60 min on one proof
> - **Partial credit**: Write what you know, even if incomplete

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Confusing "injective" and "surjective"
- ❌ Writing "obvious" instead of proving rigorously
- ❌ Circular reasoning in proofs
- ❌ Mixing up "element of" and "subset of"
- ❌ Forgetting to check all relation properties

### What Graders Look For

- ✓ Precise definitions (exact wording)
- ✓ Complete proofs (no gaps in logic)
- ✓ Clear explanations (not just symbols)
- ✓ Correct examples and counterexamples
- ✓ Proper mathematical notation
