# TM1: Set Theory + Binary Relations

**When**: Week 7 (after Test 2)
**Duration**: 120 minutes
**Format**: Closed book

## Coverage

### Set Theory (Weeks 1-2, 6)

- Set operations and laws
- Power sets
- Cartesian products
- Russell's paradox
- Axiomatic set theory (ZFC)
- Cardinality
- Cantor's arguments
- Schroeder-Bernstein theorem

### Binary Relations (Weeks 3-7)

- Properties of relations
- Equivalence relations ‚Üî partitions
- Order relations
- Hasse diagrams
- Functions and their properties
- Composition and inverses
- Lattices and Boolean algebras

## Sample Questions

### Definitions

- Define equivalence relation. Give example.
- What is a well-ordering?
- Define power set. What is |ùí´(A)| if |A| = n?

### Theorems

- State and prove: equivalence ‚Üî partition
- State Cantor's theorem. Sketch proof.
- Prove composition of functions is associative.

### Proofs

- Prove ‚Ñù is uncountable.
- Show: if f, g bijective, then g ‚àò f bijective.
- Prove every finite poset has maximal element.

### Conceptual

- Explain why Russell's paradox matters.
- Difference between maximal and greatest element?
- Example: injective but not surjective function.

## Preparation

- Review all definitions (can recite precisely?)
- Know major theorem statements
- Practice proof techniques
- Create concept maps
- Form study groups
- Attend review session
