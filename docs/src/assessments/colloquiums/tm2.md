## 📚 Coverage

The second theoretical minimum covers key concepts from the latter modules of the course:

### ⚡ Boolean Algebra (Weeks 8--10)

- Boolean functions and truth tables
- Boolean laws and duality principle
- Normal forms (DNF, CNF)
- Logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR)
- Functional completeness
- Karnaugh maps
- Quine-McCluskey algorithm

### 🧠 Formal Logic (Weeks 11--15)

- Propositional logic (syntax and semantics)
- Tautologies, contradictions, contingencies
- Logical equivalence and consequence
- Natural deduction proof systems
- Soundness and completeness
- Predicate logic with quantifiers
- Categorical logic and syllogisms

## 📝 Sample Questions

### Definitions

- Define tautology, contradiction, contingency
- What is functional completeness?
- Define logical consequence
- What is DNF? What is CNF?
- Define soundness vs completeness

### Theorems

- State the completeness theorem
- Show {NAND} is functionally complete
- Every Boolean function has DNF representation
- De Morgan's laws

### Proofs

- Prove transitivity of implication using natural deduction
- Show De Morgan's law using truth table or Boolean algebra
- Prove a tautology is valid in all interpretations
- Show {NAND} can express AND, OR, NOT

### Conceptual

- Relationship between Boolean algebra and logic?
- Difference between soundness and completeness?
- Why can't we use truth tables for predicate logic?
- What makes a gate set universal?

## ✅ What You Must Know

- Boolean operations (AND, OR, NOT) and laws
- DNF and CNF normal forms
- Functional completeness concept
- Tautologies, contradictions, contingencies
- Logical equivalence and consequence
- Soundness vs completeness distinction
- Natural deduction inference rules (modus ponens, modus tollens, etc.)
- Quantifier negation rules
- Key theorems: Completeness theorem, De Morgan's laws, functional completeness proofs
- Proof techniques: truth tables, Boolean algebra, natural deduction, gate construction

## 📖 Preparation Checklist

### ✅ Week 14 (2 weeks before)

- [ ] Review all lecture notes from Weeks 8--15
- [ ] Memorize all Boolean laws
- [ ] List all natural deduction rules
- [ ] Practice proofs in natural deduction

### ✅ Week 15 (1 week before)

- [ ] Can recite all definitions precisely?
- [ ] Practice functional completeness proofs
- [ ] Join study group, quiz on theorems
- [ ] Attend review session

### ✅ Day Before

- [ ] Review materials once
- [ ] **Get 8 hours sleep!**
- [ ] Stay calm and confident

## 💡 Pro Tips

> **🎯 Success Strategy**
>
> - **Laws are your tools**: Memorize Boolean laws cold
> - **Name your inference rules**: In proofs, cite "Modus Ponens", "∧-Intro", etc.
> - **Truth tables work**: When stuck, build truth table
> - **K-maps are visual**: Practice grouping patterns
> - **Quantifiers are tricky**: Double-check negations

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ Confusing semantic consequence and syntactic provability
- ❌ Wrong quantifier negation (negating "for all" gives "there exists...not", not "for all...not")
- ❌ Forgetting to justify proof steps
- ❌ K-map groups not power-of-2 sizes
- ❌ Mixing up soundness and completeness

### What Graders Look For

- ✓ Exact definitions (word-for-word accuracy)
- ✓ Named inference rules in proofs
- ✓ Clear step-by-step Boolean simplifications
- ✓ Correct gate constructions for completeness
- ✓ Proper quantifier manipulation
- ✓ Understanding of soundness/completeness distinction
