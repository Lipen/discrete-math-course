# TM2: Boolean Algebra + Formal Logic

**When**: Week 15 (after Test 4)
**Duration**: 120 minutes
**Format**: Closed book

## Coverage

### Boolean Algebra (Weeks 8-10)

- Boolean functions
- Boolean laws and duality
- Normal forms (DNF, CNF)
- Logic gates and circuits
- Functional completeness
- Karnaugh maps
- Quine-McCluskey

### Formal Logic (Weeks 11-15)

- Propositional logic: syntax, semantics
- Tautologies, contradictions
- Logical equivalence/consequence
- Natural deduction
- Soundness and completeness
- Predicate logic basics
- Quantifiers
- Categorical logic

## Sample Questions

### Definitions

- Define tautology, contradiction, contingency.
- What is functional completeness?
- Define logical consequence.

### Theorems

- State completeness theorem. What does it mean?
- Prove {NAND} is functionally complete.
- Show every Boolean function has DNF.

### Proofs

- Prove (P → Q) ∧ (Q → R) ⊢ (P → R) using natural deduction.
- Show ¬(P ∨ Q) ≡ ¬P ∧ ¬Q.
- Prove tautology is valid in all interpretations.

### Conceptual

- Relationship between Boolean algebra and logic?
- Difference between soundness and completeness?
- Why can't we use truth tables for predicate logic?

## Preparation

- Memorize key definitions
- Practice proof construction
- Understand theorem statements
- Review proof techniques
- Create summary sheets
- Study group discussions
