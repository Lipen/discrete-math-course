# 🎓 Theoretical Minimums (Colloquiums)

## 📖 Overview

**Theoretical Minimums (TMs)** are comprehensive oral/written examinations testing deep understanding of mathematical theory and proof techniques. Called "minimums" because passing them is a **minimum requirement** for course completion.

> **⚠️ Critical Requirement**: You **must pass both TMs** (score ≥50%) to receive credit for the course, regardless of your other grades.

### TM Structure

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **Number of TMs** | 4 total (2 per semester) |
| **Points Each** | 10 points |
| **Total Points** | 40 points (20% of final grade) |
| **Duration** | 120 minutes each |
| **Format** | Closed book, written + possible oral component |
| **Passing Requirement** | ≥5/10 on each TM |

## 📅 Schedule

### Fall Semester

| Exam | Coverage | Week | Topics | Passing Threshold |
|------|----------|------|--------|-------------------|
| **TM1** 📐🔗 | Modules 1--2 | Week 7 | Set Theory + Binary Relations | ≥5/10 |
| **TM2** ⚡🧠 | Modules 3--4 | Week 15 | Boolean Algebra + Formal Logic | ≥5/10 |

### Spring Semester

| Exam | Coverage | Week | Topics | Passing Threshold |
|------|----------|------|--------|-------------------|
| **TM3** 🌐💧 | Modules 5--6 | Week 7 | Graph Theory + Flow Networks | ≥5/10 |
| **TM4** 🤖🎲 | Modules 7--8 | Week 15 | Automata + Combinatorics | ≥5/10 |

## 🎯 Purpose

TMs ensure you can:

- ✓ **State definitions and theorems precisely** -- word-perfect recall
- ✓ **Construct rigorous proofs** -- logical, complete arguments
- ✓ **Explain concepts clearly** -- demonstrate understanding, not memorization
- ✓ **Make connections between topics** -- see the big picture
- ✓ **Demonstrate mathematical maturity** -- write like a mathematician

> **💡 Key Insight**: You cannot pass this course through computation alone. Theoretical understanding is **mandatory**.

## ⚖️ Difference from Tests

| Aspect | Regular Tests | Theoretical Minimums |
|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Focus** | Computation, problem-solving | Theory, definitions, proofs |
| **Resources** | Open book (notes, textbook) | Closed book (nothing allowed) |
| **Duration** | 90 minutes | 120 minutes |
| **Partial Credit** | Generous (60% method, etc.) | Limited (correctness emphasized) |
| **Passing** | No minimum threshold | **Must score ≥50%** |
| **Coverage** | 1 module (2--5 weeks) | 2 modules (7--8 weeks) |
| **Format** | Written only | Written + possible oral |
| **Question Types** | Calculations, applications | Definitions, theorem statements, proofs |

## 🔄 Retake Policy

### If You Score < 50% on a TM

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **Retakes Allowed** | One retake per TM |
| **Scheduling** | 1--2 weeks after original exam |
| **Format** | May be oral instead of written |
| **Difficulty** | Expect different (possibly harder) questions |
| **Score** | Retake score is final (does not average) |

### Important Notes

> **⚠️ Retake Strategy**
>
> - Take retake seriously -- it may be more challenging
> - Oral format requires explaining concepts verbally
> - Study gaps identified in original attempt
> - Schedule retake ASAP while material is fresh
> - Use office hours/mentors before retake

## 💪 Success Strategy

### Understanding vs. Memorization

| Memorization (❌) | Understanding (✅) |
|------------------|-------------------|
| "Learn" definitions word-by-word | Understand why definitions are structured that way |
| Memorize proof steps | Grasp proof strategy and key ideas |
| Recite theorem statements | Know when/how to apply theorems |
| Copy examples from notes | Generate your own examples |

### Preparation Timeline

| When | What to Do |
|------|-----------|
| **4 weeks before** | Start reviewing notes systematically |
| **3 weeks before** | Create definition/theorem summary sheets |
| **2 weeks before** | Practice proofs without looking at solutions |
| **1 week before** | Form study groups, quiz each other |
| **3 days before** | Review all definitions, theorem statements |
| **1 day before** | Light review, get good sleep |

## 📊 What to Expect

### Question Categories

| Category | Weight | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Definitions** | ~30% | "Define equivalence relation. Provide an example and a non-example." |
| **Theorem Statements** | ~20% | "State Cantor's theorem precisely." |
| **Proofs** | ~40% | "Prove that ℝ is uncountable." |
| **Conceptual** | ~10% | "Explain why Russell's paradox matters for set theory." |

### Grading Criteria

- **Precision**: Definitions and statements must be exact
- **Rigor**: Proofs must be logically complete
- **Clarity**: Explanations must be clear and well-organized
- **Correctness**: Right answers with valid justification

> **💡 Partial Credit**: While more limited than regular tests, you can still earn points for:
>
> - Correct definitions even if proof fails
> - Valid proof strategies even if details are wrong
> - Clear explanations of concepts

Good luck on your TMs! Remember: deep understanding is the goal. 🎓
