# Theoretical Minimums (Colloquiums)

## Overview

"Theoretical Minimums" (TMs) are comprehensive exams testing deep understanding of theory and proof techniques. Called "minimums" because passing them is a **minimum requirement** for course completion.

- **2 exams** × 10 points = 20 total
- **120 minutes** each
- **Closed book**
- **Must pass both** (≥50%) to receive course credit

## Schedule

| Exam | Coverage | Week | Passing |
|------|----------|------|---------|
| TM1 | Set Theory + Relations | 7 | ≥5.0/10 |
| TM2 | Boolean Algebra + Logic | 15 | ≥5.0/10 |

## Purpose

Ensure you can:

- State definitions and theorems precisely
- Construct rigorous proofs
- Explain concepts clearly
- Make connections between topics
- Demonstrate mathematical maturity

**You cannot pass this course without theoretical understanding.**

## Difference from Tests

| Aspect | Tests | TMs |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Focus | Computation | Theory, proofs |
| Resources | Open book | Closed book |
| Duration | 90 min | 120 min |
| Partial credit | Generous | Limited |
| Passing | No minimum | Must score ≥50% |
| Coverage | 1 module | 2+ modules |

## Retake Policy

If you fail a TM (< 50%):

- One retake allowed
- Scheduled 1-2 weeks later
