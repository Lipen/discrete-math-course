- Create concept maps
- List all theorems and definitions
- Identify weak areas

### 2 Weeks Before

- Practice proofs daily
- Form study group

- Attend office hours

### 1 Week Before

- Review session
- Practice problems
- Memorize key definitions
- Sleep well

## Proof Techniques

| Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Direct | Straightforward implication | If n even, then n¬≤ even |
| Contradiction | Proving impossibility | ‚Ñù uncountable |
| Contrapositive | Negation easier | If f not injective, ‚àÉx,y |
| Induction | Properties of ‚Ñï | Sum formula |
| Construction | Existence claims | Bijection A ‚Üí B |

## What to Memorize

### Set Theory

- 9 set laws (commutative, associative, distributive, etc.)
- Power set: |ùí´(A)| = 2^|A|
- Cantor's theorem statement
- Schroeder-Bernstein statement

### Relations

- 5 relation properties
- Equivalence ‚Üî partition theorem
- Function composition: (g ‚àò f)(x) = g(f(x))
- Poset properties

### Boolean Algebra

- Boolean laws (‚âà18)
- DNF/CNF definitions
- Functional completeness: {AND, OR, NOT}, {NAND}, {NOR}
- Gate symbols

### Logic

- Truth tables for connectives
- Natural deduction rules
- Soundness vs completeness
- Quantifier negation: ¬¨‚àÄx P(x) ‚â° ‚àÉx ¬¨P(x)

## Study Strategies

1. **Active recall**: Don't just read‚Äîrecite
2. **Spaced repetition**: Review multiple times
3. **Practice proofs**: Write them out completely
4. **Explain to others**: Best way to test understanding
5. **Use whiteboards**: Work through problems standing up

## Resources

- Lecture slides
- Textbook chapters
- Homework solutions
- Review session notes
- Study group
- Office hours

## Common Mistakes

- Circular reasoning in proofs
- Using "obvious" without justification
- Confusing necessary vs sufficient
- Mixing quantifier order
- Incomplete case analysis

## Day Before

- Light review (no cramming)
- Get 8 hours sleep
- Eat well
- Review flashcards once
- Stay calm
