# 🔗 Test 2 -- Binary Relations

## 📅 Test Details

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **Week** | Week 7 (Fall) |
| **Coverage** | Weeks 3--7 |
| **Duration** | 90 minutes |
| **Topics** | Relations, equivalence, orders, functions, cardinality |

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Relation properties (reflexive, symmetric, transitive, antisymmetric)
- Equivalence relations and partitions
- Order relations and Hasse diagrams
- Functions (injective, surjective, bijective)
- Composition of functions
- Cardinality (finite, countable, uncountable)

## 🎯 Sample Problem Types

- **Properties**: Determine which properties a given relation satisfies
- **Equivalence Classes**: Find equivalence classes for given relation
- **Hasse Diagrams**: Draw diagram for partial order
- **Functions**: Prove given function is bijective
- **Composition**: Compute composition of given functions
- **Cardinality**: Show rationals are countable using diagonalization

## ✅ Key Skills You'll Need

- Classifying relations by their properties
- Working with equivalence classes and partitions
- Drawing and interpreting Hasse diagrams
- Analyzing function properties
- Computing compositions correctly
- Understanding cardinality arguments

## 📖 Preparation Guide

### Review Materials

1. **Lecture Notes**: Module 2 (Binary Relations)
2. **Homework**: HW 2
3. **Textbook**: Kenneth Rosen

### Practice Problems

- **Relations**: Check properties for 10+ different relations
- **Equivalence**: Find equivalence classes for modular arithmetic
- **Hasse Diagrams**: Draw for divisibility, subset, lexicographic order
- **Functions**: Prove injectivity/surjectivity for various \\( f : A \to B \\)
- **Composition**: Compute compositions and verify associativity
- **Cardinality**: Review proofs that \\(\mathbb{N}\\), \\(\mathbb{Z}\\), \\(\mathbb{Q}\\) are countable; \\(\mathbb{R}\\) is uncountable

### Common Pitfalls

> **⚠️ Watch Out!**
>
> - Antisymmetric is NOT the same as "not symmetric" (check definition!)
> - In Hasse diagrams, don't draw transitive edges
> - Composition order: \\( f \circ g \\) means "\\(f\\) after \\(g\\)"
> - Equivalence classes must partition the set (disjoint and cover all)
> - Injection and surjection are different concepts!

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Test systematically** -- for properties, check all pairs methodically
- **Use counterexamples** -- one pair can disprove a property
- **Hasse diagrams** -- start with minimal/maximal elements
- **Function proofs** -- use "suppose \\(f(a) = f(b)\\)" for injection
- **Cardinality** -- know diagonalization and zig-zag arguments
- **Partition check** -- equivalence classes should be disjoint and exhaustive
