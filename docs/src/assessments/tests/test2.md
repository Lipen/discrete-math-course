# Test 2: Binary Relations

**Week**: 7  
**Coverage**: Weeks 3-7  
**Duration**: 90 minutes

## Topics Covered

- Relation properties (reflexive, symmetric, transitive, etc.)
- Equivalence relations and partitions
- Order relations and Hasse diagrams
- Functions (injective, surjective, bijective)
- Composition
- Cardinality (finite, countable, uncountable)

## Sample Problem Types

1. **Properties**: Determine which properties R satisfies
2. **Equivalence classes**: Find equivalence classes for given relation
3. **Hasse diagrams**: Draw diagram for partial order
4. **Functions**: Prove f is bijective
5. **Composition**: Compute f âˆ˜ g
6. **Cardinality**: Show set is countable/uncountable

## Key Skills

- Classifying relations
- Working with equivalence classes
- Drawing Hasse diagrams

- Composing correctly
- Cardinality arguments

## Preparation

- Review Lectures 2-4 notes
- Rework Homework 2 problems
