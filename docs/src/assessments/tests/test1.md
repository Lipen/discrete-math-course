# Test 1: Set Theory

**Week**: 3  
**Coverage**: Weeks 1-2  
**Duration**: 90 minutes

## Topics Covered

- Set operations (∪, ∩, \, ⊖, complement)
- Venn diagrams
- Power sets
- Cardinality of finite sets
- Cartesian products
- Set identities and proofs

## Sample Problem Types

1. **Operations**: Given sets A, B, C, compute A ∪ (B \ C)
2. **Venn diagrams**: Draw diagram for (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C)
3. **Proofs**: Prove A \ (B ∪ C) = (A \ B) ∩ (A \ C)
4. **Power sets**: Find |𝒫(A)| for given A
5. **Cartesian products**: Determine A × B for specific sets

## Key Skills

- Fluency with set notation
- Visual reasoning (Venn diagrams)
- Proof techniques (element method, double inclusion)
- Understanding power sets
- Cartesian product calculations

## Preparation

- Review Lecture 1 notes
- Rework Homework 1 problems
- Practice textbook exercises (Rosen Ch 2.1-2.2)
- Create formula/identity reference sheet
