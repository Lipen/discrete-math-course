# 📐 Test 1 -- Set Theory

## 📅 Test Details

| Detail | Information |
|--------|-------------|
| **Week** | Week 3 (Fall) |
| **Coverage** | Weeks 1--2 |
| **Duration** | 90 minutes |
| **Topics** | Set operations, Venn diagrams, power sets, cardinality |

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Set operations (union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference, complement)
- Venn diagrams
- Power sets
- Cardinality
- Cartesian products
- Set identities (De Morgan's, distributive, etc.)
- Basic proofs with sets

## 🎯 Sample Problem Types

- **Operations**: Compute set expressions
- **Venn Diagrams**: Draw and shade regions for given formulas
- **Proofs**: Prove set identities using element method
- **Power Sets**: Calculate power set size for given set
- **Cartesian Products**: Find Cartesian products for specific sets
- **Cardinality**: Apply inclusion-exclusion principle

## ✅ Key Skills You'll Need

- Fluency with set notation
- Visual reasoning with Venn diagrams
- Proof techniques (element method, double inclusion)
- Understanding power sets
- Computing Cartesian products
- Applying set identities

## 📖 Preparation Guide

### Review Materials

1. **Lecture Notes**: Module 1 (Set Theory)
2. **Homework**: HW 1
3. **Textbook**: Kenneth Rosen

### Practice Problems

- **Basic**: All set operations on 2--3 sets
- **Venn Diagrams**: Shade regions for complex expressions
- **Proofs**: Element method for 5--10 identities
- **Power Sets**: Calculate for sets of size 0--5
- **Products**: Cartesian products with different cardinalities

### Common Pitfalls

> **⚠️ Watch Out!**
>
> - Don't confuse "element of" with "subset of"
> - Remember: set difference is not commutative
> - Power set of empty set has one element (the empty set itself)
> - Venn diagrams: label all regions clearly

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Show all work** -- even for "obvious" set operations
- **Use element method** -- "let \\(x \in A\\)..." is your friend
- **Draw diagrams** -- Venn diagrams help verify your work
- **Check edge cases** -- test with empty set, singletons
- **Double-check notation** -- { } vs ( ) matters!
