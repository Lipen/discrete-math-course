# 💡 Test Tips & Success Strategies

## ⏰ Time Management

| Phase | Duration | Strategy |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Initial Scan** | 2--3 min | Read all problems, identify easiest ones |
| **Problem Solving** | 10--15 min/problem | Start with easiest |
| **Review** | 5--10 min | Check answers, catch errors |
| **Buffer** | Remaining time | Return to skipped problems |

### Pro Time Tips

- [x] **Quick wins first** -- boost confidence with easy problems
- [x] **Don't get stuck** -- if problem takes >20 min, move on
- [x] **Watch the clock** -- check time every 20--25 minutes
- [x] **Always review** -- use any remaining time to verify work
- [x] **Partial credit** -- write what you know even if incomplete

### Essential Practices

| Do This | Why |
|---------|-----|
