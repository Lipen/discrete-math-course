### Possible Topics

#### 🍁 Fall Semester

- Equivalence relations and partitions theorem

### Tips for Success

✅ **Do This:**

- Start with precise definition
- Give concrete example
- Explain significance/applications
- Connect to related concepts
- Be honest if you don't know something

❌ **Don't Do This:**

- Memorize without understanding
- Rush through explanation
- Ignore the question asked
- Make up false information
- Panic if you don't know everything

## 💻 Practical Component (6 points)

### Practical Format Details

### Typical Problem Types

#### Fall Semester Examples

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Boolean Minimization** | Implement Quine-McCluskey algorithm |
| **Truth Table Solver** | Build SAT solver or tautology checker |
| **Logic Circuit Design** | Create circuit optimizer |
| **Set Operations** | Implement power set or partition generator |
| **Cardinality Proofs** | Construct bijections programmatically |

#### Spring Semester Examples

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Automata Simulation** | Build DFA/NFA simulator |
| **Regular Expression** | Implement regex to NFA converter |
| **Graph Algorithms** | Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, or flow algorithm |
| **Combinatorial Counting** | Implement counting formula or recurrence solver |
| **Generating Functions** | Build coefficient extractor or series manipulator |

### Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Working Solution** | Code runs without errors, produces correct output |
| **Documentation** | Clear README explaining approach and usage |
| **Code Quality** | Well-commented, readable, organized |
| **Test Cases** | Include examples demonstrating correctness |
| **Explanation** | Written description of algorithm/approach |
| **Analysis** | Time/space complexity if applicable |

### Practical Evaluation Criteria

|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Correctness** | ~50% | Does it solve the problem correctly? |
| **Efficiency** | ~20% | Is the approach reasonable? (Not necessarily optimal) |
| **Documentation** | ~20% | Is explanation clear and complete? |
| **Completeness** | ~10% | Are all parts addressed, edge cases handled? |

### Submission Checklist

Before submitting, verify:

- [ ] Code compiles/runs without errors
- [ ] At least 3--5 test cases included with expected output
- [ ] README file explains problem, approach, and usage
- [ ] Code is well-commented
- [ ] Edge cases are handled (empty input, large input, etc.)
- [ ] Time/space complexity mentioned (rough estimate OK)
- [ ] All files organized in clear directory structure
- [ ] Your name and student ID in submission

### Common Pitfalls

> **⚠️ Avoid These Mistakes**
>
> - **Starting too late** -- budget 10--15 hours total work
> - **No documentation** -- code without explanation loses points
> - **No test cases** -- how do we know it works?
> - **Overcomplicated** -- simple correct solution beats complex buggy one
> - **Not asking questions** -- clarify requirements early!

## 🎯 Strategy for Success

### Prioritization

1. **Week 14**: Start reviewing for written exam
2. **End of semester**: Begin practical component immediately when released
3. **Before written part**: Intensive review, finish practical
4. **After written part**: Prepare for verbal part, submit practical
5. **Verbal exam day**: Light review, stay calm

### Balance Strategy

- **Don't** neglect practical to study for written
- **Do** budget time for all three components
- **Don't** assume verbal part will be easy
- **Do** practice explaining concepts aloud
- **Don't** overcomplicate the practical solution
- **Do** test thoroughly and document well

Good luck with your exams! 🎓
