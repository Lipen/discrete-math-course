## 📋 Overview

The course has **two final exams** -- one for each semester. Each exam consists of **three components** designed to assess different aspects of your mastery.

### Exam Structure

| Component | Points | Format | Duration |
|-----------|--------|--------|----------|
| **Written Exam** | 16 | Closed book | 120 minutes |
| **Oral Defense** | 8 | Individual interview | 15--20 minutes |
| **Practical Problems** | 6 | Take-home | ~1 week |
| **Total per Exam** | **30** | Combined | -- |

> **💡 Key Point**: Each semester's exam counts 20 points (scaled from 30), so **2 exams × 20 = 40 total points** (20% of final grade).

- Stay calm, think before speaking
- It's OK to say "I don't know" and reason from what you do know

### For Practical Component

- **Start early** -- don't wait until last minute!
- Read problem carefully, plan before coding
- Test with simple cases first
- Document your approach as you work
- Ask clarifying questions early

## 🎓 Final Thoughts

The final exam is comprehensive but fair. It tests what you've learned throughout the semester. Trust your preparation, manage your time well, and demonstrate your understanding.
