| **Study Partner** | Take turns explaining topics | Immediate feedback |
| **Record Yourself** | Video/audio your explanations | Identify weak spots |
| **Anticipate Questions** | List 5 follow-ups for each topic | Prepares for grilling |
| **Connect Topics** | Draw concept maps | Shows understanding depth |

### During the Oral Exam

#### Opening Strategy

1. **Take a breath** -- don't rush
2. **Organize mentally** (30 sec is OK)
3. **Start with definition** -- precise terminology
4. **Give intuition** -- explain in plain language
5. **Provide example** -- concrete instance
6. **State significance** -- why it matters

#### Handling Questions

| Situation | How to Respond |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Know the answer** | Answer confidently and completely |
| **Partially know** | Share what you know, admit gaps honestly |
| **Don't know** | "I don't recall, but based on X, I'd reason..." |
| **Need clarification** | "Could you rephrase the question?" |
| **Stuck on detail** | "The main idea is..., though I'm unsure about..." |

> **üí° Pro Tip**: Honesty + reasoning > making stuff up. Graders value logical thinking over perfect recall.

## üíª Practical Component Strategy

### Getting Started (Week 15)

| Day | Task | Hours |
|-----|------|-------|
| **Day 1** | Read problem carefully, understand requirements | 1--2 |
| **Day 2** | Research approach, plan algorithm/structure | 2--3 |

### Implementation Tips

‚úÖ **Best Practices:**

- **Start simple** -- get basic version working first
- **Test early** -- don't wait until end to run code
- **Comment as you code** -- explain tricky parts
- **Handle edge cases** -- empty input, single element, large input
- **Use clear variable names** -- readability matters
- **Modular design** -- break into functions/methods

‚ùå **Common Mistakes:**

- Overcomplicating the solution
- No incremental testing
- Waiting until last minute
- Poor or missing documentation
- Not asking clarifying questions
- Ignoring provided test cases

### Documentation Checklist

Your README should include:

- [ ] **Problem Description**: What are you solving?
- [ ] **Approach**: High-level strategy and algorithm
- [ ] **Usage Instructions**: How to run your code
- [ ] **Examples**: 3--5 test cases with expected output
- [ ] **Complexity Analysis**: Time/space complexity (rough estimate)
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: How you handle special inputs
- [ ] **Assumptions**: Any simplifications made
- [ ] **Dependencies**: Required libraries/tools

### Code Quality Standards

| Aspect | Good ‚úÖ | Bad ‚ùå |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Comments** | Explain non-obvious logic | Every line commented OR no comments |
| **Naming** | `findShortestPath()` | `func1()`, `x2`, `temp` |
| **Structure** | Organized into functions | One giant main() |
| **Testing** | Multiple test cases | "It worked once" |
| **Error Handling** | Check inputs, handle errors | Assume perfect input |

## üéØ Final Wisdom

### Success Mindset

> **Remember:**
>
> - You've studied all semester -- trust your preparation
> - Partial credit is generous -- write what you know
> - One exam doesn't define you or your understanding

> - The goal is learning, grades follow understanding

### Last-Minute Checklist

**Day before written exam:**

- [ ] Light review (1--2 hours max)
- [ ] Prepare materials (pens, ID, water)
- [ ] Get 8 hours of sleep
- [ ] Set multiple alarms

**Day before oral exam:**

- [ ] Practice explaining 3--5 key topics aloud
- [ ] Review definition flashcards once
- [ ] Stay relaxed and confident
- [ ] Practical component already submitted ‚úì

**Day before practical due:**

- [ ] Code runs without errors ‚úì
