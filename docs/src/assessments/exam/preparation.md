# Exam Preparation

## Timeline

### Week 14-15

- Review all materials
- Create comprehensive notes
- Practice problems from all modules
- Form study groups

### Week 15

- **Practical component released**
- Start working immediately
- Budget 10-15 hours
- Ask questions early

### Week 16 (Exam Week)

- **Written exam**: Closed-book review
- **Practical due**: Final testing/documentation
- **Oral exam**: Review random topics

## Written Prep

### Study Strategy

1. **Review lecture slides** (all 16 weeks)
2. **Redo homework problems** without solutions
3. **Practice test problems** under time pressure
4. **Memorize key theorems** and proofs
5. **Create formula sheet** (then DON'T bring it—memory aid only)

### Focus Areas

| Topic | Priority | What to Know |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Boolean minimization | HIGH | Karnaugh maps, Quine-McCluskey |
| Natural deduction | HIGH | All rules, proof construction |
| Equivalence/order | MEDIUM | Properties, examples |
| Cardinality | MEDIUM | Arguments, key theorems |
| Set laws | LOW | Basic operations |

### Practice Plan

- Week 14: Review modules 1-2
- Week 15: Review modules 3-4
- Week 16: Mixed practice, timing

## Oral Prep

### Possible Topics

You might be asked about any major concept. Common ones:

- Equivalence relations ↔ partitions
- Cantor's theorem
- Functional completeness
- Soundness vs completeness
- Boolean duality
- Natural deduction rules

### Preparation

- **Explain aloud**: Practice with study partner
- **Anticipate questions**: "Why?", "Example?", "Proof?"
- **Know connections**: How topics relate
- **Have examples ready**: Concrete instances

### During Oral

- Take a breath before starting
- Organize thoughts (30 sec OK)
- Start with definition
- Give example
- Explain significance
- Be honest if unsure

## Practical Prep

### Getting Started

1. Read problem carefully
2. Plan approach before coding
3. Test with simple cases
4. Document as you go
5. Leave time for writeup

### Common Pitfalls

- Starting too late
- No test cases
- Poor documentation
- Overcomplicated solution
- Not asking for clarification

### Submission Checklist

- [ ] Code runs without errors
- [ ] Test cases included
- [ ] README with explanation
- [ ] Approach documented
- [ ] Edge cases handled
- [ ] Time complexity noted

## Study Resources

### Official

- All lecture slides
- Homework with solutions
- Test problems
- TM questions
- Textbook chapters

### Additional

- Office hours (increased before exam)
- Review sessions
- Study groups
- Telegram channel

## Week Before Tips

1. **Sleep**: 8 hours nightly
2. **Exercise**: Reduces stress
3. **Eat well**: Brain needs fuel
4. **No cramming**: Spaced review better
5. **Stay calm**: You've prepared all semester

## Day Of

### Written Exam

- Arrive early
- Bring writing materials
- Read all problems first
- Manage time (15 min/problem)
- Show all work

### Oral Exam

- Review notes once lightly
- Stay relaxed
- Listen carefully to question
- Think before speaking
- Ask for clarification if needed

## After Exam
