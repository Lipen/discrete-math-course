# 💡 Homework Tips & FAQs

## 🎯 Success Strategies

1. **Start early** -- Begin 1--2 weeks before the deadline
2. **Read carefully** -- Understand what each problem is asking
3. **Try alone first** -- Struggling builds real understanding
4. **Discuss when stuck** -- Get hints, but write solutions independently
5. **Check your work** -- Verify answers and reasoning
6. **Write clearly** -- Pretend you're teaching someone
7. **Show all steps** -- Partial credit requires visible work
8. **Prepare for defense** -- Truly understand your solutions

## 🤝 Collaboration Guidelines

When working on homework assignment, you are _allowed_ and _forbidden_ from the following:

### ✅ Allowed

- Discussing problem-solving approaches and strategies
- Explaining mathematical concepts to peers
- Working through example problems together
- Asking clarifying questions about problem statements
- Forming study groups to learn together

### ❌ Not Allowed

- Using LLM/AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- Copying solutions from anyone (classmates, internet, previous years)
- Sharing your written solutions with others
- Dividing problems among group members
- Submitting work you don't understand

> **Golden Rule**: If you can't defend it in 10 minutes, it's not yours.

## 📚 Resources You Can Use

| Resource | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| **Lecture notes** | Primary reference material |
| **Textbooks** | Rosen, Epp, Hammack, etc. |
| **Course materials** | Cheatsheets, examples |
| **Telegram group** | General conceptual questions |
| **Mentors** | Hints and guidance (not solutions) |
| **Study groups** | Discussion and peer learning |

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Can I submit handwritten solutions?**
A: Yes, this is the intended format. Just ensure your handwriting is legible.

**Q: Can I submit electronically typed solutions?**
A: Typed solutions (LaTeX/Typst) are welcome. Word files are discouraged.

**Q: What if I'm stuck on a problem?**
A: Struggle for at least 30 minutes, then ask for hints (not solutions) from mentors or in study groups.

**Q: Can I resubmit after the deadline?**
A: Yes, but late penalties may apply. Better to submit something on time than nothing at all.

**Q: What exactly counts as plagiarism?**
A: Copying any part of a solution from anyone or anywhere without working it out yourself.

**Q: What if I miss my defense appointment?**
A: Zero score until you manage to re-schedule the defense with a mentor.

**Q: How detailed should my solutions be?**
A: Show enough work that someone could follow your reasoning. Include definitions, justifications, and key steps. During defense, you may be asked to explain any part of your solution. After several defenses, you'll get a sense of how much detail is expected by your instructor.

**Q: Can I submit early?**
A: Yes! Early submission gives you peace of mind and time to prepare for defense (or do other homeworks...).

## ⏰ Time Management Plan

| Timeline | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **Week 0** (release) | Read all problems, identify difficult ones |
| **Week 1** | Solve basic problems, take a look at medium ones |
| **Week 2** | Tackle medium problems, get hints for hard ones |
| **3--5 days before** | Finalize all solutions, format properly |
| **1 day before** | Final review, submit early in the day |
| **After deadline** | Review solutions thoroughly for defense |

> **💡 Remember**: Homework is where you **learn**, not just where you're **evaluated**. The goal is understanding, not just points.

## 🚀 Pro Tips

- **Use mentors' help** -- Don't waste time stuck when help is available
- **Form study groups** -- Teaching others solidifies your understanding
- **Test edge cases** -- Check if your answer works for simple/extreme values
- **Read problem statements twice** -- Many mistakes come from misreading
- **Start with what you know** -- Build from familiar concepts
- **Take breaks** -- Fresh eyes catch errors better
