# 💬 Homework Defense

## 🎯 What is Defense?

All homework must be defended orally in a **10--15 minute discussion** with the instructor or mentor.

**Purpose**: Verify that you genuinely understand your own solutions and can explain the reasoning behind them.

## ⏰ When & Where

- **Scheduled**: After submission deadline
- **Sign-up**: Posted in Telegram group
- **Location**: During organized hours or dedicated defense slots
- **Attendance**: Mandatory --- missing defense = zero score

> **📅 Tip**: Sign up early to get a convenient time slot!

## 🗣️ What to Expect

During the defense, you may be asked to:

1. **Explain** your solution to a specific problem
2. **Justify** particular steps in your reasoning
3. **Answer** "what if" variations or edge cases
4. **Define** mathematical terms you used
5. **Solve** a similar problem on the spot

> **💡 Key Point**: The goal is to demonstrate understanding, not memorization!

## 📚 How to Prepare

- ✓ **Review** all your solutions thoroughly
- ✓ **Understand** why each step works (not just that it works)
- ✓ **Practice** explaining solutions aloud (to yourself or a friend)
- ✓ **Bring** a copy of your submission for reference
- ✓ **Be ready** to solve similar problems

> **⚠️ Warning**: Solutions copied from others will be immediately obvious during defense!

## 📊 Possible Outcomes

| Result | Meaning | Next Steps |
|--------|---------|------------|
| ✅ **Successful** | Full credit | Homework complete! |
| ⚠️ **Partial** | Minor gaps | Small point deductions |
| ❌ **Failed** | Significant issues | Resubmission required |
| 🚫 **Plagiarism** | Copied work detected | Zero score + academic report |

## 🎓 Tips for Success

- **Think first** -- Take a moment before answering, don't rush
- **Structure clearly** -- Organize your explanation logically
- **Use examples** -- Illustrate abstract concepts with concrete cases
- **Be honest** -- Admit uncertainty rather than guess confidently
- **Listen carefully** -- Pay attention to follow-up questions
- **Stay calm** -- It's a learning experience, not an interrogation!

## ❓ Common Defense Questions

- "Can you explain why you used this approach?"
- "What would happen if we changed this condition?"
- "Can you define this term in your own words?"
- "How would you solve this similar problem?"
- "What's the intuition behind this step?"

> **💡 Pro Tip**: If you can teach the concept to someone else, you're ready for defense!
