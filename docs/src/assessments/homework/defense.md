# Homework Defense

## What is Defense?

All homework must be defended orally in a **10-15 minute discussion** with instructor or TA.

**Purpose**: Verify you understand your own solutions

## When & Where

- Scheduled **after submission deadline**
- Sign-up sheet posted in Telegram
- During office hours or dedicated slots
- **Attendance mandatory** - missing = zero score

## What to Expect

You may be asked to:

1. Explain your solution to a problem
2. Justify a step in your reasoning
3. Answer "what if" variations
4. Define terms you used
5. Solve a similar problem

## Preparation

- Review all solutions beforehand
- Understand *why* each step works
- Be ready to solve similar problems
- Bring copy of submission
- Practice explaining aloud

## Possible Outcomes

| Result | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Successful** | Full credit, homework complete |
| **Partial** | Minor issues, small deductions |
| **Failed** | Significant gaps, resubmission required |
| **Plagiarism** | Zero score, reported |

## Tips for Success

- Take time to think before answering
- Structure your response clearly
- Use examples to illustrate concepts
- Admit uncertainty (better than wrong confident answer)
- Listen carefully to follow-up questions
