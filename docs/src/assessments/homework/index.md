## 📚 Problem Structure

Each assignment contains ~10 problems divided by difficulty:

| Level | Problems | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Basic** | 3--4 | Practice fundamentals, build confidence |
| **Medium** | 4--5 | Apply techniques, develop skills |
| **Challenge** | 1--2 | Extend understanding, deepen insight |

## 🎯 Why Homework Matters

1. **Practice** -- Reinforce concepts through hands-on problem-solving
2. **Preparation** -- Build skills needed for tests and exams
3. **Feedback** -- Identify knowledge gaps early
4. **Independence** -- Develop mathematical thinking and rigor

## ✅ Passing Requirements

- **Minimum score**: Typically 80% (8/10 points)
- Below threshold → Resubmission required
- **All homework must be passed** to complete the course

> **⚠️ Important**: Even with high test scores, you cannot pass the course without completing all homework!
