= Regular Languages

== Regular Expressions

Regular languages can be composed from "smaller" regular languages.

- Atomic regular expressions:
  - $emptyset$, an empty language
  - $epsilon$, a singleton language consisting of a single $epsilon$ word
  - $regex("a")$, a singleton language consisting of a single 1-letter word $a$, for each $a in Sigma$

- Compound regular expressions:
  - $R_1 R_2$, the concatenation of $R_1$ and $R_2$
  - $R_1 | R_2$, the union of $R_1$ and $R_2$
  - $R^* = R R R dots$, the Kleene star of $R$
  - $(R)$, just a bracketed expression
  - Operator precedence: $regex("ab*c|d") eq.delta ((regex("a") (regex("b")^*)) regex("c")) | regex("d")$

== Re-visiting States

- Let $D$ be a DFA with $n$ states.
- Any string $w$ accepted by $D$ that has length at least $n$ must visit some state twice.
- Number of states visited is equal to $abs(w) + 1$.
- By the pigeonhole principle, some state is "duplicated", i.e. visited more than once.
- The substring of $w$ between those _revisited states_ can be removed, duplicated, tripled, etc. without changing the fact that $D$ accepts $w$.

  })
]

Informally:
- Let $L$ be a regular language.
- If we have a string $w in L$ that is "sufficiently long", then we can _split_ the string into _three pieces_ and _"pump"_ the middle.
- We can write $w = x y z$ such that $x y^0 z$, $x y^1 z$, $x y^2 z$, ..., $x y^n z$, ... are all in $L$.
  - Notation: $y^n$ means "$n$ copies of $y$".

== Weak Pumping Lemma

#theorem[Weak Pumping Lemma for Regular Languages][
  - For any regular language $L$,
    - There exists a positive natural number $n$ (also called _pumping length_) such that
      - For any $w in L$ with $abs(w) >= n$,
        - There exists strings $x$, $y$, $z$ such that
          - For any natural number $i$,
            - $w = x y z$ ($w$ can be broken into three pieces)
            - $y != epsilon$ (the middle part is not empty)
            - $x y^i z in L$ (the middle part can repeated any number of times)
]

#example[
  Let $Sigma = {0, 1}$ and $L = { w in Sigma^* | w "contains" 00 "as a substring" }$.
  Any string of length 3 or greater can be split into three parts, the second of which can be "pumped".
]

#example[
  Let $Sigma = {0, 1}$ and $L = { epsilon, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11 }$.
  The weak pumping lemma still holds for finite languages, because the pumping length $n$ can be longer than the longest word in the language!
]

== Testing Equality

#definition[
  The _equality problem_ is, given two strings $x$ and $y$, to decide whether $x = y$.
]

#example[
  Let $Sigma = {0, 1, "#"}$.
  We can _encode_ the equality problem as a string of the form _$x "#" y$_.
  - "Is _001_ equal to _110_ ?" would be _$001 "#" 110$_.
  - "Is _11_ equal to _11_ ?" would be _$11 "#" 11$_.
  - "Is _110_ equal to _110_ ?" would be _$110 "#" 110$_.

  Let $"EQUAL" = { w "#" w | w in {0, 1}^* }$.

  *Question:* Is $"EQUAL"$ a _regular_ language?
]

A typical word in $"EQUAL"$ looks like this: $001 "#" 001$.
- If the "middle" piece is just a symbol $"#"$, then observe that $001 thin 001 notin "EQUAL"$.
- If the "middle" piece is either completely to the left or completely to the right of $"#"$, then observe that any duplication or removal of this piece is not in $"EQUAL"$.
- If the "middle" piece includes $"#"$ and any symbols from the left/right of it, then, again, observe that any duplication or removal of this piece is not in $"EQUAL"$.

#theorem[
  $"EQUAL"$ is not a regular language.
]

#proof[
  By contradiction.
  Assume that $"EQUAL"$ is a regular language.

  Let $n$ be the pumping length guaranteed by the weak pumping lemma.
  Let $w = 0^n "#" 0^n$, which is in $"EQUAL"$ and $abs(w) = 2n + 1 >= n$.
  By the weak pumping lemma, we can write $w = x y z$ such that $y != epsilon$ and for any $i in NN$, $x y^i "#" z in "EQUAL"$.
  Then $y$ cannot contain $"#"$, since otherwise if we let $i = 0$, then $x y^0 "#" z = x "#" z$ does not contain $"#"$ and would not be in $"EQUAL"$.
  So $y$ is either completely to the left of $"#"$ or completely to the right of $"#"$.

  Let $abs(y) = k$, so $k > 0$.
  Since $y$ is completely to the left or right of $"#"$, then #box[$y = 0^k$].

  Now, we consider two cases:
  #enum(numbering: i => "Case " + str(i) + ":")[
    $y$ is to the left of $"#"$.
    Then $x y^2 z = 0^(n+k) "#" 0^n notin "EQUAL"$, contradicting the weak pumping lemma.
  ][
    $y$ is to the right of $"#"$.
    Then $x y^2 z = 0^n "#" 0^(n+k) notin "EQUAL"$, contradicting the weak pumping lemma.
  ]
  In either case we reach a contradiction, so our assumption was wrong.
  Thus, $"EQUAL"$ _is not regular_.
]

= Non-regular Languages

== (Not only) Regular Languages

- The weak pumping lemma describes a property common to _all_ regular languages.
- Any language $L$ which does not have this property _cannot be regular_.
- What other languages can we find that are not regular?

#example[
  Consider the language $L = {0^n 1^n | n in NN}$.
  - $L = {epsilon, 01, 0011, 000111, 00001111, ...}$
  - $L$ is a classic example of a non-regular language.
  - *Intuitively:* if you have _only finitely many states_ in a DFA, you cannot _"remember"_ an arbitrary number of $0$s to match _the same_ number of $1$s.

  How would we prove that $L$ is non-regular?
]

#fancy-box[
  Use the Pumping Lemma to show that $L$ _cannot_ be regular.

== Pumping Lemma as a Game

The weak pumping lemma can be thought of as a _game_ between #Green[*you*] and an #Red[*adversary*].
- #Green[*You win*] if you can prove that the pumping lemma _fails_.
- #Red[*The adversary wins*] if the adversary can make a choice for which the pumping lemma _succeeds_.

The game goes as follows:
- #Red[The adversary] chooses a pumping length $n$.
- #Green[You] choose a string $w$ with $abs(w) >= n$ and $w in L$.
- #Red[The adversary] breaks it into $x$, $y$, and $z$.
- #Green[You] choose an $i$ such that $x y^i z notin L$ _(if you can't, you lose!)_.

== Formal Proof of Non-regularity

#theorem[
  $L = { 0^n 1^n | n in NN }$ is not regular.
]

#proof[
  By contradiction.
  Assume that $L$ is regular.

  Let $n$ be the pumping length guaranteed by the weak pumping lemma ("there exists $n$...").
  Consider the string $w = 0^n 1^n$.
  Then $abs(w) = 2n >= n$ and $w in L$, so we can write (split) $w = x y z$ such that $y != epsilon$ and for any $i in NN$, we have $x y^i z in L$.

  We consider three cases:
  #enum(numbering: i => "Case " + str(i) + ":")[
    $y$ consists solely of $0$s.
    Then $x y^0 z = x z = 0^(n-abs(y)) 1^n$, and since $abs(y) > 0$, $x z notin L$.
  ][
    $y$ consists solely of $1$s.
    Then $x y^0 z = x z = 0^n 1^(n-abs(y))$, and since $abs(y) > 0$, $x z notin L$.
  ][
    $y$ consists of $k > 0$ $0$s followed by $m > 0$ $1$s.
    Then $x y^2 z = 0^n 1^m 0^k 1^n$, so $x y^2 z notin L$.
  ]
  In all three cases we reach a contradiction, so our assumption was wrong and $L$ is not regular.
]

= Pumping Lemma

== Pumping

Consider the language $L$ over $Sigma = {0, 1}$ of strings $w in Sigma^*$ that contain _an equal number_ of $0$s and $1$s.

For example:
- #Green[`01`] in $L$
- #Red[`11011`] not in $L$
- #Green[`110010`] in $L$

*Question:* Is $L$ a _regular_ language?

Let's _use_ the weak pumping lemma to show it is by _pumping all the strings_ in this language.

#proof[(incorrect)][
  We are going to show that $L$ satisfies the conditions of the weak pumping lemma.
  Let $n = 2$.
  Consider any string $w in L$ (i.e., $w$ contains the same number of $0$s and $1$s) with $abs(w) >= 2$.

  We can split $w = x y z$ such that $x = z = epsilon$ and $y = w$, so $y != epsilon$.
  Then, for any natural number $i in NN$, $x y^i z = w^i$, which has the same number of $0$s and $1$s.

  Since $L$ passes the conditions of the weak pumping lemma, $L$ is regular.
]

== A word of Caution

- The weak and full pumping lemmas describe the _necessary_ condition of regular languages.
  - If $L$ is _regular_, then it _passes_ the conditions of the pumping lemma.
  - If a language _fails_ the pumping lemma, it is _definitely not regular_.

- The weak and full pumping lemmas are _not a sufficient_ condition of regular languages.
  - If $L$ is _not regular_, then it still _may pass_ the conditions of the pumping lemma.
  - If a language _passes_ the pumping lemma, we _learn nothing_ about whether it is regular or not.

== The Stronger Pumping Lemma

The language $L$ _can_ be proven to be _non-regular_ using a _stronger version_ of the pumping lemma.

For the intuition behind the "full" pumping lemma, let's revisit our original observation.
- Let $D$ be a DFA with $n$ states.
- Any string $w$ accepted by $D$ of length at least $n$ must visit some state twice _within its first $n$_ symbols.
  - The number of visited states is equal to $n + 1$.
  - By the pigeonhole principle, some state is _duplicated_.
- The substring of $w$ between those _revisited states_ can be removed, duplicated, tripled, etc. without changing the fact that $D$ accepts $w$.

Overall, we can add the following condition to the weak pumping lemma:
$
  abs(x y) <= n
$
This restriction means that we can limit where the string to pump must be.
If we specifically choose the first $n$ characters of the string to pump, we can ensure $y$ (middle part) to have a specific property.

We can then show that $y$ cannot be pumped arbitrarily many times.

== Formal Proof of Non-regularity

#theorem[
  $L = { w in {0,1}^* | w "has an equal number of 0s and 1s" }$ is _not regular_.
]

#proof[
  By contradiction.
  Assume that $L$ is regular.

  Let $n$ be the pumping length guaranteed by the weak pumping lemma.
  Consider the string $w = 0^n 1^n$.
  Then $abs(w) = 2n >= n$ and $w in L$.
  Therefore, there exist strings $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that $w = x y z$, $abs(x y) <= n$, #box[$y != epsilon$], and for any $i in NN$, we have $x y^i z in L$.

  Since $abs(x y) <= n$, $y$ must consist solely of $0$s.
  But then $x y^2 z = 0^(n+abs(y)) 1^n$, and since $abs(y) > 0$, $x y^2 z notin L$.

  We have reached a contradiction, so our assumption was wrong and $L$ is not regular.

== Summary of the Pumping Lemma

+ These lemmas describe essential properties of the _regular_ languages.

+ Any language that _fails_ to have these properties _can not be regular_.

  That is, $B$ is exactly like $A$, but with the accepting states flipped.

== Closure under Intersection

#theorem[
  If $L$ and $M$ are regular languages, then so is their intersection $L intersect M$.
]

#proof[(simple)][
  $L intersect M = overline(overline(L) union overline(M))$.
]
#proof[
  We can directly construct a "product" DFA for the intersection of two regular languages.

  Let $L$ and $M$ be the languages of automata $A_L = (Q_L, Sigma, delta_L, q_L, F_L)$ and $A_M = (Q_M, Sigma, delta_M, q_M, F_M)$.
  Note that we assume that the alphabets of both automata are the same (or $Sigma$ is their union).
  // The product construction also works for NFAs, but to keep things simple we assume that both $A_L$ and $A_M$ are DFAs.

  For $L intersect M$, we construct the automaton $A$ that simulates both $A_L$ and $A_M$.
  The states of $A$ are the product of the states of $A_L$ and $A_M$.
  The initial state is $(q_L, q_M)$, and the accepting states are $F_L times F_M$.
  The transitions are defined as $delta(angle.l p, q angle.r, c) = angle.l delta_L (p, c), delta_M (q, c) angle.r$.

  To see why $lang(A) = lang(A_L) intersect lang(A_M)$, first observe that $hat(delta) (angle.l q_L, q_M angle.r, w) = angle.l hat(delta)_L (q_L, w), hat(delta)_M (q_M, w) angle.r$.
  But $A$ accepts $w$ if and only if $hat(delta) (q_0, w)$ is in $F_L times F_M$, which occurs if and only if $hat(delta)_L (q_L, w)$ is in $F_L$ and $hat(delta)_M (q_M, w)$ is in $F_M$.
  Or rather, $A$ accepts $w$ if and only if both $A_L$ and $A_M$ accept $w$.
  Thus, $A$ accepts the intersection of $L$ and $M$.

  The first automaton on the left accepts all strings that _have a 0_.

  On the right, we show the _product_ of these two automata.
  Its states are labelled by the pairs of states of the two automata.
  It is easy to see that this automaton accepts the _intersection_ of the two languages: all strings that _have both a 0 and a 1_.

== Closure under Difference

#theorem[
  If $L$ and $M$ are regular languages, then so is their difference $L minus M$.
]

#proof[
  Observe that $L minus M = L intersect overline(M)$.
  By previous theorems, $overline(M)$ is regular, and $L intersect overline(M)$ is also regular.
]

== Closure under Reversal

#definition[
  The _reversal_ of a string $w = a_1 a_2 dots a_n$ is the string $w^R = a_n a_(n-1) dots a_1$.

  #example[
    $0010^R = 0100$ and $epsilon^R = epsilon$.
  ]
]

#definition[
  The _reversal_ of a language $L$ is the language $L^R = { w^R | w in L }$.

  #example[
    Let $L = { 001, 10, 111 }$, then $L^R = { 001^R, 10^R, 111^R } = { 100, 01, 111 }$.
  ]
]

#theorem[
  If $L$ is a regular language, then so its reversal $L^R$.
]

#proof[
  Assume $L$ is defined by regular expression $E$.
  The proof is a structural induction on the size of $E$.
  We show that there is another regular expression $E^R$ such that $lang(E^R) = (lang(E))^R$, that is, the language of $E^R$ is the reversal of the language of $E$.

  _Basis:_ If $E$ is $epsilon$, $emptyset$, or $regex("a")$ for some symbol $a$, then $E^R$ is the same as $E$.

  _Induction:_ There are three cases, depending on the form of $E$.
  + $E = E_1 + E_2$.
    Then $E^R = E_1^R + E_2^R$.

    The justification is that the reversal of the union of two languages is obtained by computing the reversals of the two languages and taking the union of those languages.

  + $E = E_1 E_2$. Then $E^R = E_2^R E_1^R$.
    Note that we reverse the order of the two languages, as well as reversing the languages themselves.
    For example, if $lang(E_1) = {0,1 111}$ and $lang(E_2) = {00, 10}$, then $lang(E_1 E_2) = {0100, 0110, 11100, 11110}$.
    The reversal of the latter language is
    $
      {0010, 0110, 00111, 01111}
    $
    If we concatenate the reversals of $lang(E_2)$ and $lang(E_1)$, we get
    $
      {00,01} {10, 111} = {0010, 00111, 0110, 01111}
    $
    which is the same language as $(lang(E_1 E_2))^R$.
    In general, if a word $w$ in $lang(E)$ is the concatenation of $w_1$ from $lang(E_1)$ and $w_2$ from $lang(E_2)$, then $w^R = w_2^R w_1^R$.

  + $E = E_1^*$. Then $E^R = (E_1^R)^*$.

    The justification is that any string $w$ in $lang(E)$ can be written as $w_1 w_2 dots w_n$, where each $w_i$ is in $lang(E_1)$.
    Then $w^R = w_n^R w_(n-1)^R dots w_1^R$.
    Each $w_i^R$ is in $lang(E^R)$, so $w^R$ is in $lang((E_1^R)^*)$.

    Conversely, any string in $lang((E_1^R)^*)$ is of the form $w_1 w_2 dots w_n$, where each $w_i$ is the reversal of a string in $lang(E_1)$.
    The reversal of this string, $w_n^R w_(n-1)^R dots w_1^R$, is therefore a string in $lang(E_1^*)$, which is $lang(E)$.

    We have thus shown that a string is in $lang(E)$ if and only if its reversal is in $lang((E_1^R)^*)$.
]

#example[
  Let $L$ be defined by the regular expression $regex("(0+1)0*")$.
  Then $L^R$ is the language of $(regex("0*"))^R (regex("0+1"))^R$.

  If we apply the rules for Kleene star and union to the two parts, and then apply the basis rule that says the reversals of $regex("0")$ and $regex("1")$ are unchanged, we find that $L^R$ has regular expression $regex("0*(0+1)")$.

= Decision Properties of Regular Languages

== Fundamental Questions about Languages

+ Is the language _empty_?

+ Is the language _finite_?

+ Is the particular string $w$ _in_ the language?

+ Is the language a _subset_ of another language?

+ Are the two languages _equivalent_?

== Decision Procedures

*Converting among representations*
- $epsilon$-closure: $O(n^3)$
- $epsilon$-NFA to DFA: $n^3 2^n$
- DFA to $epsilon$-NFA: $O(n)$
- $epsilon$-NFA to RegEx: $O(n^3 4^n)$
- RegEx to $epsilon$-NFA: $O(n)$

*Testing _emptiness_ of a regular language*
- Given an automaton, we can determine whether the accepting states are reachable, in $O(n^2)$ time.
- Given a regular expression, we can construct an $epsilon$-NFA and then determine the reachability of the accepting states, in $O(n)$ time.
  Alternatively, we can inspect the regex directly.

*Testing _membership_ in a regular language*
- Given an automaton with $s$ states and a string $w$ of size $n$, we can simulate the automaton for $w$ to determine whether it accepts $w$.
  - For DFA, this can be done in $O(n)$ time.
  - For NFA or $epsilon$-NFA, in $O(n s^2)$.

== Emptiness, Finiteness, Infiniteness

#theorem[
  The language $L$ accepted by a finite automaton with $n$ states is _non-empty_ iff the finite automaton accepts a word of length less than $n$.
]

#theorem[
  The language $L$ accepted by a finite automaton $M$ with $n$ states is _infinite_ iff the automaton accepts some word of length $l$, where $n <= l < 2n$.
]

#proof[
  If $w$ is in $lang(M)$ and $n <= abs(w) < 2n$, then by the Pumping lemma, $lang(M)$ is infinite.
  That is, $w = x y z$, and for all $i$, $x y^i z$ is in $L$.
  Conversely, if $lang(M)$ is infinite, then there exists $w$ in $lang(M)$, where $abs(w) >= n$.
  If $abs(w) < 2n$, we are done.
  If no word is of length between $n$ and $2n - 1$, let $w$ be of length at least $2n$, but as short as any word in $lang(M)$ whose length is greater than of equal to $2n$.
  Again by the Pumping lemma, we can write $w = x y z$ with $1 <= abs(y) <= n$ and $x z in lang(M)$.
  Either $w$ was not the shortest word of length $2n$ or more, or $abs(x z)$ is between $n$ and $2n - 1$, a contradiction in either case.
