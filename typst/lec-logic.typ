== Propositional Logic

#definition[
  Logic is the study of valid reasoning.
]

#definition[
  Formal logic is the study of deductively valid inferences or logical truths.
]

#example[
  _Modus ponens_ inference rule:
  #grid(
    columns: 1,
    inset: 5pt,
    $P$,
    $P arrow.r Q$,
    grid.hline(stroke: .8pt),
    $therefore Q$,
  )
]

#definition[Propositional Logic][
  The simplest form of logic, dealing with whole statements (_propositions_) that can be either #True or #False.

  Also known as _sentential logic_ or _zeroth-order logic_.
]

== Syntax: The Language of Logic

#Block[
  *Syntax* concerns the formal _structure_ of logical expressions --- how symbols are arranged according to grammatical rules, _independent of meaning_.
]

#definition[
  A propositional _language_ consists of:
  - _Propositional variables_: $P, Q, R, dots$ (atomic propositions)
  - _Logical connectives_: $not, and, or, imply, iff$
  - _Punctuation_: parentheses for grouping
]

#definition[
  A _well-formed formula_ (WFF) in propositional logic is defined recursively:
  - Every propositional variable is a WFF.
  - If $alpha$ is a WFF, then $not alpha$ is a WFF.
  - If $alpha$ and $beta$ are WFFs, then $(alpha and beta)$, $(alpha or beta)$, $(alpha imply beta)$, $(alpha iff beta)$ are WFFs.
  - Nothing else is a WFF.
]

== Semantics: The Meaning of Logic

#Block[
  *Semantics* concerns the _meaning_ (or _interpretation_) of logical expressions --- how they relate to _truth_ values and the world.
]

// #definition[
//   An _interpretation_ assigns meaning to the symbols of a logical language, determining truth values for formulas.
// ]

- Each propositional variable is assigned a truth value: #True or #False.
- More formally, an _interpretation_ $nu : V to BB$ assigns truth values ($BB = {0,1}$) to variables (atoms) $V$.

// #definition[
//   An _interpretation_ $nu : V to BB$ assigns truth values ($BB = {0,1} = {#false, #true}$) to propositional variables (atoms) $V$.
// ]

#let EvalWith(phi, inter) = $bracket.double.l phi bracket.double.r_(inter)$
#let Eval(phi) = EvalWith(phi, $nu$)

#definition[
  The truth value (_evaluation_) of complex formulas is determined recursively:
  $
           Eval(not alpha) & = True  && "iff" Eval(alpha) = False \
      Eval(alpha and beta) & = True  && "iff" Eval(alpha) = True "and" Eval(beta) = True \
       Eval(alpha or beta) & = True  && "iff" Eval(alpha) = True "or" Eval(beta) = True "(or both)" \
    Eval(alpha imply beta) & = False && "iff" Eval(alpha) = True "and" Eval(beta) = False \
      Eval(alpha iff beta) & = True  && "iff" Eval(alpha) = Eval(beta)
  $
]

== Truth Tables

#definition[
  A _truth table_ systematically lists all possible truth value assignments to propositional variables and shows the resulting truth values of complex formulas.
]

#example[Truth Tables for Basic Connectives][
  #grid(
    columns: 3,

== Semantic Concepts

#definition[
  A formula $phi$ is _satisfiable_ if there exists an interpretation $nu$ such that $EvalWith(phi, nu) = True$.

  A formula is _unsatisfiable_ if no such interpretation exists.
]

#definition[
  A formula $phi$ is a _tautology_ (or _valid_) if $EvalWith(phi, nu) = True$ for every interpretation $nu$.

  Notation: $models phi$ (read: "$phi$ is valid").
]

#definition[
  A formula $phi$ is a _contradiction_ if $EvalWith(phi, nu) = False$ for every interpretation $nu$.
]

#example[
  - $P or not P$ is a tautology (Law of Excluded Middle)
  - $P and not P$ is a contradiction
  - $P or Q$ is satisfiable but not a tautology
]

== Logical Equivalence

#definition[
  Two formulas $alpha$ and $beta$ are _logically equivalent_, written $alpha equiv beta$, if they have the same truth value under every interpretation:
  $
    alpha equiv beta
    quad "iff" quad
    forall nu. thin EvalWith(alpha, nu) = EvalWith(beta, nu)
  $
]

      - $not not P equiv P$

      *Implication:*
      - $P imply Q equiv (not P) or Q$

    [
      *Associativity:*
      - $(P and Q) and R equiv P and (Q and R)$

      *Commutativity:*
      - $P and Q equiv Q and P$
      - $P or Q equiv Q or P$

      *Distributivity:*
      - $P and (Q or R) equiv (P and Q) or (P and R)$
    ],
  )
]

== Semantic Entailment

#definition[
  A set of formulas $Gamma$ _semantically entails_ a formula $alpha$, written $Gamma models alpha$, if every interpretation that makes all formulas in $Gamma$ true also makes $alpha$ true:
  $
    Gamma models alpha
    quad "iff" quad
    forall nu. thin (forall beta in Gamma. thin EvalWith(beta, nu) = True) imply EvalWith(alpha, nu) = True
  $
]

#example[
  ${P imply Q, P} models Q$ (this captures modus ponens semantically)
]

#theorem[Semantic Deduction Theorem][
  For any formulas $alpha$ and $beta$:
  $
    {alpha} models beta
    quad "iff" quad
    models alpha imply beta
  $
]

== Normal Forms

#definition[
  A _literal_ is either a propositional variable $P$ or its negation $not P$.
]

#definition[
  A formula is in _conjunctive normal form_ (CNF) if it is a conjunction of disjunctions of literals:
  $
    (L_(1,1) or dots or L_(1,k_1)) and dots and (L_(n,1) or dots or L_(n,k_n))
  $

  Each disjunction $(L_(i,1) or dots or L_(i,k_i))$ is called a _clause_.
]

#definition[
  A formula is in _disjunctive normal form_ (DNF) if it is a disjunction of conjunctions of literals:
  $
    (L_(1,1) and dots and L_(1,k_1)) or dots or (L_(n,1) and dots and L_(n,k_n))
  $
]

#theorem[Normal Form Existence][
  Every propositional formula is logically equivalent to a formula in CNF and to a formula in DNF.
]

// TODO: add complete conversion algorithm steps
#example[
  $(P imply Q) and R$

  Converting to CNF:
  1. Eliminate implications: $(not P or Q) and R$
  2. Already in CNF: $(not P or Q) and R$

  Converting to DNF:
  1. Distribute: $(not P and R) or (Q and R)$
]

// TODO: Mention that CNF is preferred for SAT solvers, and DNF is better for some model checking applications.

== Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT)

#definition[SAT Problem][
  Given a propositional formula $phi$, determine whether $phi$ is satisfiable.
]

#theorem[Cook-Levin Theorem][
  SAT is NP-complete.
]
// TODO: proof

== From Semantics to Syntax

// TODO: Emphasize that we want syntactic methods that match semantic truths.

#Block[
  So far we've studied _semantics_ --- what formulas _mean_ in terms of truth values.

  Now we turn to _syntax_ --- how to _prove_ formulas using purely symbolic manipulation, without reference to truth values.
]

#definition[
  A _proof system_ consists of:
  - _Axioms_: formulas assumed to be true
  - _Inference rules_: patterns for deriving new formulas from existing ones

  A _proof_ of $phi$ is a sequence of formulas ending with $phi$, where each formula is either an axiom or follows from previous formulas by an inference rule.
]

#definition[Syntactic Derivability][
  We write $Gamma proves phi$ (read: "$Gamma$ proves $phi$") if there exists a proof of $phi$ using axioms and formulas from $Gamma$ as premises.
]

// TODO: The goal is to make syntactic derivability ($proves$) match semantic entailment ($models$).

== Natural Deduction

#definition[Natural Deduction][
  A proof system where formulas are derived using _introduction_ and _elimination_ rules for each logical connective.

  Proofs are typically presented in _Fitch notation_ --- a structured format showing the logical dependencies.
]

== Fitch Notation

#Block[
  Fitch notation uses vertical lines and indentation to show proof structure:
  - Vertical lines indicate scope of assumptions
  - Horizontal lines separate assumptions from conclusions
  - Each step is numbered and justified
]

// Visualization suggestion: Show a simple Fitch proof with boxes and lines
// Use actual Fitch diagram format with numbered steps, assumptions in boxes

#example[Fitch Proof Structure][
  ```
  1  | P â Q        Premise
  2  | P            Premise

  By induction on proof structure:

  *Base case:* Axioms and premises are semantically valid by assumption.

== Proof of Completeness

#proof[
  We prove the contrapositive: if $Gamma proves.not alpha$, then $Gamma models.not alpha$.

  The _strategy_ is to construct a model (interpretation) that satisfies all formulas in $Gamma$, but falsifies $alpha$.

  #enum(numbering: it => [*Step #it:*])[
    If $Gamma proves.not alpha$, then $Gamma union {not alpha}$ is consistent (cannot derive $bot$).

    Extend $Gamma union {not alpha}$ to a _maximal consistent set_ $Delta$:
    - $Delta$ is consistent (cannot derive $bot$)
    - For every formula $beta$, either $beta in Delta$ or $not beta in Delta$
  ][
    Define interpretation $nu$ for atomic propositions $P$ by:
    $ nu(P) = True iff P in Delta $
  ][
    Show by induction that for all formulas $beta$:
    $ Eval(beta) = True iff beta in Delta $
  ][
    Since $not alpha in Delta$, we have $Eval(alpha) = False$.
    Since $Gamma subset.eq Delta$, we have $Eval(gamma) = True$ for all $gamma in Gamma$.

== Translation Between Traditional and Modern Logic

#definition[
  Categorical propositions can be translated into first-order logic:

    columns: 3,
    align: left,
    stroke: (x, y) => if y == 0 { (bottom: 0.8pt) },
    table.header([Traditional], [Modern Logic], [Reading]),
    [All S are P], [$forall x (S(x) â P(x))$], ["For all x, if x is S then x is P"],
    [No S are P], [$forall x (S(x) â Â¬P(x))$], ["For all x, if x is S then x is not P"],
    [Some S are P], [$exists x (S(x) â§ P(x))$], ["There exists x such that x is S and x is P"],
    [Some S are not P], [$exists x (S(x) â§ Â¬P(x))$], ["There exists x such that x is S and x is not P"],

#example[
  "All students are hardworking" becomes:
  $forall x (text("Student")(x) â text("Hardworking")(x))$

  "Some politicians are not honest" becomes:
  $exists x (text("Politician")(x) â§ Â¬text("Honest")(x))$
]

== The Existential Import Problem

#definition[
  A proposition "$S$ is $P$" has _existential import_ if it implies the existence of objects (at~least one) in its subject class $S$.
]

#Block(color: orange.lighten(50%))[
  *The Problem:*

  Traditional logic (Aristotle) assumes all categorical propositions have existential import.

  Modern logic questions this assumption.

  Consider: "All unicorns are magical"
  - Traditional: Implies unicorns exist (so the statement is false)
  - Modern: True vacuously (if there are no unicorns, the implication holds trivially)
]

#pagebreak(weak: true)

#example[Impact on the Square][
  In modern logic with empty domains:
  - A and E can both be true (if subject class is empty)
  - I and O can both be false (if subject class is empty)
  - Subalternation fails (A can be true while I is false)

  The traditional square of opposition only works when we assume non-empty subject classes.
]

== Syllogisms: Reasoning with Categories

#definition[
  _Categorical syllogism_ is a form of reasoning with three categorical propositions:
  - _Major premise_: contains the predicate of the conclusion
  - _Minor premise_: contains the subject of the conclusion
  - _Conclusion_: derived from the premises

  Uses exactly three terms: major, minor, and middle.
]

#definition[
  The _mood_ of a syllogism is the 3-letter sequence of categorical forms (A, E, I, O) of its three propositions, in order: major premise, minor premise, conclusion.

== Distribution of Terms

#definition[
  A term is _distributed_ in a proposition if the proposition says something about _all_ members of the class denoted by that term.

  - Only _universal_ propositions (A, E) distribute their _subject_ term.
  - Only _negative_ propositions (E, O) distribute their _predicate_ term.

== Rules for Valid Syllogisms

#definition[Validity Rules][
  A categorical syllogism is valid if and only if it satisfies all these rules:

  1. *Exactly three terms* (no equivocation)
  2. *Middle term distributed at least once*
  3. *No term distributed in conclusion unless distributed in premise*
  4. *No conclusion from two negative premises*
  5. *Negative conclusion if and only if exactly one negative premise*
  6. *No particular conclusion from two universal premises* (if existential import assumed)
]

== Venn Diagrams for Categorical Logic

#definition[Venn Diagram Method][
  Categorical propositions can be represented using Venn diagrams with two or three circles.

  - Shaded regions represent empty classes
  - X marks represent existing individuals
  - Overlap patterns show relationships between categories
]

// TODO: Show Venn diagrams for each categorical form.

#example[Venn Diagram for Syllogism][
  Testing Barbara (AAA-1):
  - All M are P: Shade M outside P
  - All S are M: Shade S outside M
  - Conclusion: All S are P

  The diagrams show that S must be entirely within P, validating the syllogism.
]

== Modern Developments

#Block[
  Traditional categorical logic has evolved in several directions:

  - *Set theory*: Categories become sets, relations become set operations
  - *Formal semantics*: Precise treatment of quantification and scope
  - *Knowledge representation*: Description logics in AI and semantic web
  - *Natural language processing*: Computational linguistics and parsing
  - *Database theory*: Query languages and constraint systems
]

// TODO: Traditional logic isn't obsolete - it's foundational

== Limitations of Traditional Logic

#Block(color: yellow.lighten(40%))[
  Traditional categorical logic has important _limitations_:
  + Only handles simple quantification (all, some, no)
  + Cannot express complex relationships (between more than two categories)
  + Limited to categorical structure (subject--predicate form)
  + Struggles with relational statements ("John is taller than Mary")
  + No systematic treatment of compound statements
  + Existential import controversies
]

#example[What traditional logic cannot express][
  - "Every student likes some professor" (multiple quantifiers)
  - "If John is happy, then Mary is happy" (conditional with individuals)
  - "All numbers between 5 and 10 are prime" (complex domain restrictions)
  - "Most birds can fly" (non-standard quantifiers)
  - "Students who study hard usually succeed" (statistical generalizations)
]

== The Legacy of Traditional Logic

#Block(color: blue.lighten(60%))[
  *Enduring Contributions:*
  =
  - Systematic study of quantification and categorical reasoning
  - Recognition of logical form vs. content
  - Analysis of validity in natural language arguments
  - Foundation for formal semantics and knowledge representation
  - Critical thinking tools for evaluating everyday reasoning

  *Modern Relevance:*
  Traditional logic remains important for understanding human reasoning patterns, developing AI systems that interact naturally with humans, and teaching critical thinking skills.

== Theories and Models

#definition[
  A _theory_ $T$ is a set of first-order formulas (axioms).
]

#definition[
  A structure $cal(M)$ is a _model_ of theory $T$ if $cal(M) models phi$ for every formula $phi in T$.
]

#example[Group Theory][
  The theory of groups has axioms:
  - (Associativity) $forall x, y, z. thin (x dot (y dot z)) = ((x dot y) dot z)$
  - (Identity) $exists e. forall x. thin (x dot e = x) and (e dot x = x)$
  - (Inverses) $forall x. exists y. thin (x dot y = e) and (y dot x = e)$

  Models include $angle.l ZZ, + angle.r$, $angle.l RR setminus {0}, dot angle.r$, etc.

== Interactive Theorem Provers

#Block[
  Modern mathematics increasingly uses _interactive theorem provers_ â computer systems that assist in constructing and verifying formal proofs.

== Completeness and Decidability

#theorem[GÃ¶del][
  First-order logic is complete: every semantically valid formula is provable.
]

#theorem[Church][
  First-order logic is undecidable: there is no algorithm that determines whether an arbitrary first-order formula is valid.
]

// TODO: incompleteness theorem for arithmetic

#Block(color: orange.lighten(50%))[
  *The trade-off:*
  - Propositional logic: decidable (SAT-solvable) but has _limited expressiveness_
  - First-order logic: highly expressive but _undecidable_
  - Higher-order logic: even more expressive but _incomplete_
]

// TODO: Emphasize that this illustrates fundamental limitations in automated reasoning: we gain expressiveness at the cost of decidability.

  *Key insights:*
  - Syntax and semantics can be perfectly aligned (completeness)
  - Expressiveness comes at the cost of decidability
  - Formal logic provides foundations for mathematical reasoning and computation
  - Interactive theorem provers make formal logic practically useful
