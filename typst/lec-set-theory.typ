== Introduction

Set theory provides a foundational language for all of mathematics.
_Everything_ from numbers and functions to spaces and relations can be defined using _sets_.
This lecture introduces the basic objects and operations of set theory and explores their deep structural and logical consequences.

Topics include:
- Basic concepts: elements, subsets, operations
- Relations and functions as sets
- Infinite sets and cardinality
- Axiomatic foundations
- Applications in logic and computer science

== Basic Notions

#definition[
  A _set_ is an unordered collection of distinct objects, called _elements_.

  - In _naÃ¯ve_ set theory, sets can contain _any_ objects (including non-sets, called _urelements_).
  - In modern _axiomatic_ set theory, _everything is a set_ (no urelements).
]

#example[
  $A = {5, #emoji.koala, #emoji.bird}$ is a set of three elements: the number 5, a koala, and a birb.
]

*Notation:* $a in A$ means "$a$ is _an element of_ $A$".

#example[
  "$#emoji.koala in A$" is #True, while "$#emoji.penguin in A$" is #False, denoted as "$#emoji.penguin notin A$".
]

#definition[Extensionality][
  Two sets are _equal_, denoted $A = B$, if they have the same elements, that is, iff every element of $A$ is also in $B$, and vice versa.
  Formally, $A = B$ iff $A subset.eq B$ and $B subset.eq A$.
]

#example[
  ${a, b, b} = {a, b} = {b, a} = {b, a, b}$, all these denote the same set with elements $a$ and $b$.
]

== Set-Builder Notation

#definition[
  A set can be defined using _set-builder notation_ (_set comprehension_):
  $ A = { x | P(x) } $
  meaning "the set of all $x$ such that the property $P(x)$ holds".
]

#example[
  $A = { x | x in NN and x > 5 }$ is the set of natural numbers greater than 5, that is, $A = {6, 7, 8, dots}$.
]

#example[
  $S = { x^2 | x "is prime" } = {4, 9, 25, 49, dots}$ is the set of squares of prime numbers#footnote[*Note:* $1$ _is not_ a prime number.].
]

#example[
  $QQ = { a "/" b | a in ZZ, b in NN, b != 0 }$ is the set of rational numbers (fractions).
]

== Subsets

#definition[
  A set $A$ is a _subset_ of $B$, denoted $A subset.eq B$, if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$.
  - Formally, $A subset.eq B iff forall x. thin (x in A) imply (x in B)$.
  - If $A$ is not a subset of $B$, we write $A subset.eq.not B$.
  - If $A subset.eq B$ and $A neq B$, we say $A$ is a _proper (or strict) subset_ of $B$, denoted $A subset B$ or $A subset.neq B$.
  - If $A$ is a subset of $B$, denoted $A subset.eq B$, then $B$ is a _superset_ of $A$, denoted $B supset.eq A$.
]

#example[
  Every set is a subset of itself: $A subset.eq A$.
]
#example[
  The empty set is a subset of every set: $emptyset subset.eq A$ for any set $A$.
]
#example[
  The set of even numbers is a proper subset of the set of integers: $ZZ_"even" subset ZZ$.
]
#example[
  ${a,b} subset.eq {a,b,c}$, but ${a,b,x} subset.eq.not {a,b,c}$.
]
#example[
  ${0} in {0, {0}}$ _and_ ${0} subset.eq {0, {0}}$, that is, ${0}$ is an element, and also a subset.
]

// TODO: visualize subsets using Euler diagrams (nested circles)

== Power Sets

#definition[
  The _power set_ of a set $A$, denoted $2^A$ or $power(A)$, is the set of all subsets of $A$.
  $ power(A) = { S | S subset.eq A } $
]

#example[
  If $A = {a, b}$, then $power(A) = {emptyset, {a}, {b}, {a, b}}$.
]
#example[
  If $A = {1, 2, 3}$, then $power(A) = {emptyset, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}$.
]
#example[
  The power set of the empty set is $power(emptyset) = {emptyset}$, a _non-empty_ set containing the empty set.
]

#theorem[
  $abs(power(A)) = 2^abs(A)$ for any finite set $A$.
]

#proof[(combinatorial)][
  For each of the $n$ elements in the set, we can either include it in a subset or not.
  These $n$ independent binary choices yield $2^n$ possible subsets by the multiplication principle.
  #place(center)[
    $ underbrace(2 times 2 times dots times 2, n "times") = 2^n $
  ]
]

#pagebreak()

#proof[
  By _induction_ on $n = abs(A)$, the cardinality of the set $A$.

  *Base case:*
  If $n = 0$, then $A = emptyset$ and $power(A) = {emptyset}$.
  Thus, $abs(power(A)) = 1 = 2^0$.

  *Inductive step:*
  Assume the formula holds for any set of size $k$.
  Let $A$ be a set with $abs(A) = k+1$.
  Choose an arbitrary element $a in A$ and let $A' = A setminus {a}$, so $abs(A') = k$.

  The power set $power(A)$ can be partitioned into two _disjoint_ collections:
  + Subsets of $A$ that _do not_ contain $a$.
    This collection is exactly $power(A')$.
    By the inductive hypothesis, it has $abs(power(A')) = 2^k$ elements.
  + Subsets of $A$ that _do_ contain $a$.
    Each such subset is of the form $S union {a}$ where $S subset.eq A'$.
    This establishes a bijection with $power(A')$, so this collection also has $2^k$ elements.

  The total number of subsets of $A$ is the _sum_ of their sizes: $abs(power(A)) = 2^k + 2^k = 2 dot 2^k = 2^(k+1) = 2^abs(A)$.
]

    edge(<s0>, <s3>, "-}>"),
  )
]

== Some Important Sets

#example[
  $NN = {0, 1, 2, dots}$ is the set of natural numbers.
]
#example[
  $ZZ = {dots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, dots}$ is the set of integers.
]
#example[
  $QQ = { a "/" b | a in ZZ, b in NN, b != 0 }$ is the set of rational numbers.
]
#example[
  $RR = (-infinity, +infinity)$ is the set of real numbers (the continuum).
]
#example[
  $BB = {0, 1}$ is the set of Boolean values (truth values).
]

#example[
  The set $A^*$ of _finite strings_ over an alphabet $A$ is defined as:
  $
    A^* = {epsilon} union { a_1 a_2 dots a_n | n in NN, a_i in A } = union.big_(n in NN) A^n
  $
  For example, $BB^* = { epsilon, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111, 0000, dots }$.
]

  The set $A^omega$ of _infinite sequences_ over $A$.

== Venn Diagrams and Euler Circles

#definition[
  A _Venn diagram_ is a visual representation of sets and their relationships using overlapping circles or closed curves.
  Each circle represents a set, and overlapping regions show intersections.
]

#definition[
  _Euler circles_ (or _Euler diagrams_) are a simpler form where circles may or may not overlap, and non-overlapping regions represent disjoint sets.
]

#example[
  For sets $A = {1, 2, 3}$ and $B = {2, 3, 4}$:
  - $A intersect B = {2, 3}$ (overlapping region)
  - $A setminus B = {1}$ (left-only region)
  - $B setminus A = {4}$ (right-only region)
  - $A union B = {1, 2, 3, 4}$ (entire diagram)
]

// TODO: Add Venn diagram visualization
//
// #example[Three-Set Venn Diagram][
//   For three sets $A$, $B$, $C$, a complete Venn diagram shows 8 regions:
//   - $A intersect B intersect C$ (center)
//   - $A intersect B intersect overline(C)$, $A intersect overline(B) intersect C$, $overline(A) intersect B intersect C$
//   - $A intersect overline(B) intersect overline(C)$, $overline(A) intersect B intersect overline(C)$, $overline(A) intersect overline(B) intersect C$
//   - $overline(A) intersect overline(B) intersect overline(C)$ (outside all sets)
// ]

== Laws of Set Operations

For any sets $A$, $B$, $C$, and the universal set $U$:

#columns(2)[
  *Commutative Laws:*
  - $A union B = B union A$
  - $A intersect B = B intersect A$

  *Associative Laws:*
  - $(A union B) union C = A union (B union C)$
  - $(A intersect B) intersect C = A intersect (B intersect C)$

  *Distributive Laws:*
  - $A union (B intersect C) = (A union B) intersect (A union C)$
  - $A intersect (B union C) = (A intersect B) union (A intersect C)$

  #colbreak()

  *De Morgan's Laws:*
  - $overline(A union B) = overline(A) intersect overline(B)$
  - $overline(A intersect B) = overline(A) union overline(B)$

  *Identity Laws:*
  - $A union emptyset = A$, $A intersect U = A$
  - $A intersect emptyset = emptyset$, $A union U = U$

  *Complement Laws:*
  - $A union overline(A) = U$, $A intersect overline(A) = emptyset$
  - $overline(overline(A)) = A$ (double complement)
]

== Tuples and Ordered Pairs

#definition[
  A _tuple_ is an ordered collection of elements, denoted $(a_1, a_2, dots, a_n)$.

  A tuple of length $n$ is called an _n-tuple_.
]

#example[
  $(42, #emoji.crab, #emoji.cat.face.angry, #emoji.kiwi)$ is a 4-tuple.
]

#definition[
  An ordered pair $pair(a, b)$ is a special 2-tuple, defined#footnote[Kuratowski's definition is the most cited and now-accepted definition of an ordered pair. For others, see #link("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordered_pair#Defining_the_ordered_pair_using_set_theory")[wiki].] as:
  $ pair(a, b) eq.def { {a}, {a, b} } $
]

#example[
  $pair(#emoji.pumpkin, #emoji.mage) != pair(#emoji.mage, #emoji.pumpkin)$, these are different ordered pairs.
]

#example[
  $pair(#emoji.cactus, #emoji.cactus) != (#emoji.cactus,) != #emoji.cactus != {#emoji.cactus}$, these are all different objects: an ordered pair, a 1-tuple, an~urelement, and a singleton~set.
  Note, however, that $pair(#emoji.cactus, #emoji.cactus) = {{#emoji.cactus}}$.
]

== Cartesian Product

#definition[
  The _Cartesian product_ of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted $A times B$, is defined as:
  $ A times B = { pair(a, b) | a in A "and" b in B } $
]

#example[
  If $A = {1, 2}$ and $B = {x, y, z}$, then their product is
  $ A times B = { pair(1, x), pair(1, y), pair(1, z), pair(2, x), pair(2, y), pair(2, z) } $
]

#definition[
  The _n-fold Cartesian product_ (also known as _Cartesian power_) of a set $A$ is defined as:
  $ A^n = underbrace(A times A times dots times A, n "times") = { (a_1, a_2, dots, a_n) | a_i in A } $
]

#example[
  ${a, b}^3 = { (a,a,a), (a,a,b), (a,b,a), (a,b,b), (b,a,a), (b,a,b), (b,b,a), (b,b,b) }$
]

#example[
  ${#emoji.eagle}^3 = { (#emoji.eagle, #emoji.eagle, #emoji.eagle) }$, the singleton set containing the 3-tuple of three eagles.
]

#example[
  $A^0 = { () }$, the singleton set containing the empty tuple.
]

// Recursively, #strike("ab")using the Kuratowski's definition and extending $n$-tuples to pairs as $(x, y, z) = pair(pair(x, y), z)$:
// - $A^1 = A$
// - $A^(k + 1) = A^k times A$

== Geometric Interpretation of Cartesian Product

The Cartesian product $A times B$ can be visualized as a region on the coordinate plane, where each point $pair(a, b)$ represents an element of the product.

#example[
  If $A = [1, 4)$ and $B = (2, 4]$, then $A times B$ represents the rectangular region (see next slide):
  $ {pair(x, y) | 1 <= x < 4 "and" 2 < y <= 4} $
]

#example[
  For discrete sets $A = {1, 2, 3}$ and $B = {1, 2}$, the product $A times B$ consists of 6 points:
  $pair(1, 1), pair(1, 2), pair(2, 1), pair(2, 2), pair(3, 1), pair(3, 2)$ arranged in a grid pattern.
]

#let example-data = (
  A: (0, 3),
  B: (0, 2),
  C: (1, 2),
  D: (0.5, 1.5),
)

#example[
  #let (
    A: (Al, Ar),
    B: (Bl, Br),
    C: (Cl, Cr),
    D: (Dl, Dr),
  ) = example-data
  The set difference $(A times B) setminus (C times D)$ where:
  - $A times B = \[Al; Ar\] times \[Bl; Br\]$ (outer rectangle)
  - $C times D = \(Cl; Cr\) times \(Dl; Dr\]$ (inner rectangle to subtract)

  The resulting set is visualized as the blue-shaded area on the right.

Suppose a set can be either _"normal"_ or _"unusual"_.
- A set is considered _normal_ if it does _not contain itself_ as an element. That is, $A notin A$.
- Otherwise, it is _unusual_. That is, $A in A$.

*Note:* being "normal" or "unusual" is a predicate $P(x)$ that can be applied to any set $x$.

)[
  Consider the set of _all normal sets_: $R = { A | A notin A }$.
]

The paradox arises when we ask: #strong[Is $R$ a normal set?]
- Suppose $R$ is _normal_. By its definition, $R$ must be an element of $R$, so $R in R$. But elements of $R$ are normal sets, and normal sets do not contain themselves. So $R notin R$. Contradiction.
- Suppose $R$ is _unusual_. This means $R$ contains itself, so $R in R$. But the definition of $R$ only includes sets that do _not_ contain themselves. So $R$ cannot be a member of $R$, i.e. $R notin R$. Contradiction.

A contradiction is reached in both cases. The only possible conclusion is that #strong[the set $R$ cannot exist].

This paradox showed that _unrestricted comprehension_ --- the ability to form a set from any arbitrary property --- is logically inconsistent.
How can we fix this?..

== From NaÃ¯ve to Axiomatic Set Theory

#definition[
  _NaÃ¯ve set theory_ allows unrestricted set formation: for any property $P(x)$, we can form the set ${x | P(x)}$.
  Russell's paradox shows this leads to contradictions.
]

#definition[
  _Axiomatic set theory_ restricts set formation through a system of axioms.

  The most widely accepted system is _Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice_ (ZFC).

== ZFC Axioms

+ *Extensionality*: Sets with the same elements are equal.
+ *Empty Set*: There exists a set $emptyset$ with no elements.
+ *Pairing*: For any $a$ and $b$, there exists a set ${a, b}$.
+ *Union*: For any collection of sets, their union exists.
+ *Power Set*: For any set $A$, the power set $power(A)$ exists.
+ *Infinity*: There exists an infinite set (containing $NN$).
+ *Separation*: From any set $A$ and property $P$, we can form ${x in A | P(x)}$.
+ *Replacement*: If $F$ is a function-like relation, then for any set $A$, the image $F[A]$ exists.
+ *Foundation*: Every non-empty set has a minimal element (prevents self-membership).
+ *Choice*: Every collection of non-empty sets has a choice function.

#note[
  The *Separation* axiom prevents Russell's paradox by only allowing formation of subsets from existing sets, not arbitrary collections.

== Relations as Sets

#definition[
  A _binary relation_ $R$ on sets $A$ and $B$ is a subset of the Cartesian product $A times B$.
]

*Notation:*
If $R subset.eq A times B$, we write "$a rel(R) b$" to mean that element $a in A$ is _related_ to element $b in B$.

#block(
  fill: yellow.lighten(80%),
  stroke: 1pt + yellow.darken(20%),
  radius: 5pt,
  outset: .5em,
)[
  Formally, $a rel(R) b$ iff $pair(a, b) in R$.
]

*Note:* $R$ is used to denote both the relation itself ($a rel(R) b$) _and_ the set of pairs ($R subset.eq A times B$).

*Note:* the _order_ of elements in the pair _matters_: $pair(a, b) in R$ denotes that $a$ is related to $b$, not the other way around, unless there is _another_ pair $pair(b, a)$ in the relation.

#example[
  $R = { pair(n, k) | n, k in NN "and" n < k }$
]

#definition[
  - A binary relation $R subset.eq A times B$ on two different sets $A$ and $B$ is called _heterogeneous_.
  - A binary relation $R subset.eq M^2$ on the same set $M$ is called _homogeneous_.

  A homogeneous relation $R subset.eq M^2$ can be represented as a _directed graph_ where:
  - Vertices correspond to elements of $M$
  - There is a directed edge from $x$ to $y$ if $x rel(R) y$, i.e. $pair(x, y) in R$
]

#example[
  For $M = {1, 2, 3}$ and $R = {pair(1, 2), pair(2, 3), pair(1, 3)}$, the graph has vertices ${1, 2, 3}$ and directed edges $1 to 2$, $2 to 3$, and $1 to 3$.

== Matrix Representation

#definition[
  A binary relation $R subset.eq A times B$ can be represented as a _matrix_ $M_R = matrel(R)$ where:
  - Rows correspond to elements of $A$
  - Columns correspond to elements of $B$
  - $M_R [i,j] = 1$ if $a_i rel(R) b_j$, and $M_R [i,j] = 0$ otherwise
]

#example[
  Let $A = {a, b, c}$, $B = {x, y}$, and $R = {pair(a, x), pair(b, x), pair(c, y)}$.
  The matrix representation is:
  $
    matrel(R) = natrix.bnat(
      1, 0;

      0, 1
    ) quad "where rows are" {a, b, c} "and columns are" {x, y}

  - _Empty relation_: $emptyset subset.eq M^2$ (no elements are related)
  - _Identity relation_: $I_M = {pair(x, x) | x in M}$ (each element related only to itself)
  - _Universal relation_: $U_M = M^2$ (every element related to every element)
]

#example[
  For $M = {a, b, c}$:
  - Empty: $emptyset$
  - Identity: ${pair(a, a), pair(b, b), (c,c)}$
  - Universal: ${pair(a, a), pair(a, b), pair(a, c) pair(b, a), pair(b, b), pair(b, c), pair(c, a), pair(c, b), pair(c, c)}$ (all 9 pairs)
]

== Operations on Relations

#definition[
  For relations $R, S subset.eq A times B$:
  - _Union_: $R union S = {pair(a, b) | pair(a, b) in R "or" pair(a, b) in S}$
  - _Intersection_: $R intersect S = {pair(a, b) | pair(a, b) in R "and" pair(a, b) in S}$
  - _Complement_: $overline(R) = (A times B) setminus R$
]

#definition[
  For a relation $R subset.eq A times B$, the _converse_ (or _inverse_) relation is:
  $
    R^(-1) = {pair(b, a) | pair(a, b) in R} subset.eq B times A
  $
]

#example[
  If $R = {pair(1, x), pair(2, y), pair(2, z)}$, then $R^(-1) = {pair(x, 1), pair(y, 2), pair(z, 2)}$.
]

== Closures of Relations

#definition[
  Let $R subset.eq M^2$ be a relation. The _closures_ of $R$ are the smallest relations containing $R$ with specific properties:

  - _Reflexive closure_: $R^+ = R union I_M$
  - _Symmetric closure_: $R^s = R union R^(-1)$
  - _Transitive closure_: $R^*$ is the smallest transitive relation containing $R$
]

// TODO: examples of reflexive closure
// TODO: examples of symmetric closure

// #theorem[
//   The transitive closure can be computed as:
//   $R^* = union.big_(n=1)^infinity R^n$
//   where $R^n = underbrace(R compose R compose dots compose R, n "times")$.
//
//   For finite sets, $R^* = R^1 union R^2 union dots union R^abs(M)$.
// ]
//
// #example[
//   Let $M = {1, 2, 3}$ and $R = {pair(1, 2), pair(2, 3)}$.
//   - $R^1 = {pair(1, 2), pair(2, 3)}$
//   - $R^2 = R compose R = {pair(1, 3)}$
//   - $R^3 = R^2 compose R = emptyset$
//   - So $R^* = {pair(1, 2), pair(2, 3), pair(1, 3)}$
// ]

== Properties of Homogeneous Relations

#definition[
  A relation $R subset.eq M^2$ is _reflexive_ if every element is related to itself:
  $ forall x in M. thin (x rel(R) x) $
]
#definition[
  A relation $R subset.eq M^2$ is _symmetric_ if for every pair of elements, if one is related to the other, then the reverse is also true:
  $ forall x, y in M. thin (x rel(R) y) imply (y rel(R) x) $
]
#definition[
  A relation $R subset.eq M^2$ is _transitive_ if for every three elements, if the first is related to the second, and the second is related to the third, then the first is also related to the third:
  $ forall x, y, z in M. thin (x rel(R) y and y rel(R) z) imply (x rel(R) z) $
]

== More Properties

#definition[
  A relation $R subset.eq M^2$ is _irreflexive_ if no element is related to itself:
  $ forall x in M. thin (x nrel(R) x) $
]
#definition[
  A relation $R subset.eq M^2$ is _antisymmetric_ if for every pair of elements, if both are related to each other, then they must be equal:
  $ forall x, y in M. thin (x rel(R) y and y rel(R) x) imply (x = y) $
]
#definition[
  A relation $R subset.eq M^2$ is _asymmetric_ if for every pair of elements, if one is related to the other, then the reverse is not true:
  $ forall x, y in M. thin (x rel(R) y) imply (y nrel(R) x) $
]

#note[
  _irreflexive_ + _antisymmetric_ = _asymmetric_.
]

== Additional Properties

#definition[
  A relation $R subset.eq M^2$ is:

  - _Coreflexive_ if $R subset.eq I_M$ (only related to themselves, if at all):
    $
      forall x, y in M. thin (x rel(R) y) imply (x = y)
    $

  - _Left Euclidean_ if whenever an element is related to two others, those two are related:
    $
      forall x, y, z in M. thin (x rel(R) y and x rel(R) z) imply (y rel(R) z)
    $

  - _Right Euclidean_ if whenever two elements are both related to a third, they are related to each other:
    $
      forall x, y, z in M. thin (y rel(R) x and z rel(R) x) imply (y rel(R) z)
    $
]

#example[
  - Identity relation $I_M$ is coreflexive.
    Any subset of $I_M$ is also coreflexive.
  - Equality relation "$=$" is left and right Euclidean.
  - "Being in the same equivalence class" is Euclidean in both directions.
]

== Equivalence Relations

#definition[
  A relation $R subset.eq M^2$ is an _equivalence relation_ if it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
]

#definition[
  Let $R subset.eq M^2$ be an equivalence relation on a set $M$.
  The _equivalence class_ of an element $x in M$ under $R$ is the set of all elements related to $x$:
  $ [x]_R = { y in M | x rel(R) y } $
]

#definition[
  The _quotient set_ of $M$ by the equivalence relation $R$ is the set of all equivalence classes:
  $ M slash_R = { [x]_R | x in M } $
]

#theorem[
  If $R subset.eq M^2$ is an equivalence relation, then $x rel(R) y$ iff $[x]_R = [y]_R$ for all $x, y in M$.
]

== Partitions

#definition[
  A _partition_ $cal(P)$ of a set $M$ is a family of non-empty, pairwise-disjoint subsets whose union is $M$:
  - (Non-empty) $forall B in cal(P). thin (B != emptyset)$
  - (Disjoint) $forall B_1, B_2 in cal(P). thin (B_1 != B_2) imply (B_1 intersect B_2 = emptyset)$
  - (Cover) $limits(union.big)_(B in cal(P)) B = M$

  Elements of $cal(P)$ are _blocks_ (or _cells_).
]

#example[
  For $M = {0,1,2,3,4,5}$: ${{0,2,4},{1,3,5}}$ and ${{0,5},{1,2,3},{4}}$ are partitions.

== Partitions and Equivalence Relations

#theorem[Equivalences $<=>$ Partitions][
  Each equivalence relation $R$ on $M$ yields the partition #box[$cal(P)_R = { [x]_R | x in M }$].
  Each partition $cal(P)$ yields an equivalence $R_cal(P)$ given by $pair(x, y) in R_cal(P)$ iff $x$ and $y$ lie in the same block.
  These constructions invert one another.
]

#proof[(Sketch)][
  Classes of an equivalence are non-empty, disjoint, and cover $M$.
  Conversely, "same block" relation is reflexive, symmetric, transitive.
  Composing the two constructions returns exactly the starting equivalence relation or partition (they are mutually inverse up to equality of sets of ordered pairs).
]

== Orders

#definition[
  A relation $R subset.eq M^2$ is called a _preorder_ if it is reflexive and transitive.
]
#definition[
  A _partial order_ is a relation $R subset.eq M^2$ that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.
]
#definition[
  A relation $R subset.eq M^2$ is _connected_ if for every pair of distinct elements, either one is related to the other or vice versa:
  $ forall x, y in M. thin (x neq y) imply (x rel(R) y or y rel(R) x) $
]
#definition[
  A partial order which is also connected is called a _total order_ (or _linear order_).
]

== Chains and Antichains

#definition[
  In a partially ordered set $(M, prec.eq)$:

  - A _chain_ is a subset $C subset.eq M$ where every two elements are comparable.
    Formally:
    $
      forall x, y in C. thin (x prec.eq y "or" y prec.eq x)
    $

  - An _antichain_ is a subset $A subset.eq M$ where no two distinct elements are comparable.
    Formally:
    $
      forall x, y in A. thin (x != y) imply (x prec.eq.not y "and" y prec.eq.not x)
    $
]

#example[
  Consider the divisibility relation $|$ on ${1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}$:
  - Chain: ${1, 2, 4, 12}$ (since $1 divides 2 divides 4 divides 12$)
  - Chain: ${1, 3, 6, 12}$ (since $1 divides 3 divides 6 divides 12$)
  - Antichain: ${2, 3}$ (since $2 divides.not 3$ and $3 divides.not 2$)
  - Antichain: ${4, 6}$ (since $4 divides.not 6$ and $6 divides.not 4$)
]

== Dilworth's Theorem

#theorem[Dilworth][
  In any finite partially ordered set, the maximum size of an antichain equals the minimum number of chains needed to cover the entire set.
]

#example[
  In the Boolean lattice $power({a, b})$ with inclusion:
  - Maximum antichain: ${{a}, {b}}$ of size 2
  - Minimum chain decomposition: ${emptyset, {a}} union {{b}, {a,b}}$ with 2 chains
]

== Examples of Orders

#example[
  Consider the _no longer than_ relation $prec.curly.eq$ on $BB^*$: $x prec.curly.eq y$ iff $"len"(x) <= "len"(y)$.
  This is a preorder (reflexive and transitive), and even connected, but not a partial order, since it is not antisymmetric: for example, $01 prec.curly.eq 10$ and $10 prec.curly.eq 01$, but $01 neq 10$.
]

#example[
  The subset relation $subset.eq$ on $power(A)$ is a partial order (reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive); typically not total, since not all subsets are comparable (e.g., $A = {1}$ and $B = {2, 3}$).
]

#example[
  Divisibility $|$ on $D = {1,2,3,6}$: $1|2|6$, $1|3|6$; $2$ and $3$ incomparable. Partial, not total.
]

#example[
  Lexicographic order on $A^n$ (induced by a total order on $A$) is a total order.
]

== Composition of Relations

#definition[
  The _composition_ of two relations $R subset.eq A times B$ and $S subset.eq B times C$ is defined as:
  $
    R rel(";") S = S compose R = { pair(a, c) | exists b in B. thin (a rel(R) b) and (b rel(S) c) }
  $
]

== Powers of Relations

#definition[
  For a homogeneous relation $R subset.eq M^2$, we define _powers_ of $R$:
  - $R^0 = I_M$ (identity relation)
  - $R^1 = R$
  - $R^(n+1) = R^n compose R$ for $n >= 1$
]

#example[
  Let $M = {1, 2, 3, 4}$ and $R = {pair(1, 2), pair(2, 3), pair(3, 4)}$ (successor relation).
  - $R^1 = {pair(1, 2), pair(2, 3), pair(3, 4)}$
  - $R^2 = {pair(1, 3), pair(2, 4)}$ (two steps)
  - $R^3 = {pair(1, 4)}$ (three steps)
  - $R^4 = emptyset$ (no four-step paths)
]

#theorem[
  For any relation $R$ on a finite set with $n$ elements:
  - $R^+ = R^1 union R^2 union dots union R^n$ is a _transitive closure_.
  - $R^* = R^0 union R^+ = I union R^+$ is a _reflexive-transitive closure_.
]

== Associativity of Composition

#theorem[
  Composition of relations is associative:
  $(R rel(";") S) rel(";") T = R rel(";") (S rel(";") T)$.
]

#proof[
  Let $R subset.eq A times B$, $S subset.eq B times C$, and $T subset.eq C times D$ be three relations.

  *($subset.eq$):*
  Let $pair(a, d) in (R rel(";") S) rel(";") T$.
  - By definition of composition:
    $exists c in C. thin (pair(a, c) in R rel(";") S) and (pair(c, d) in T)$.
  - Since $pair(a, c) in (R rel(";") S)$, we have:
    $exists b in B. thin (pair(a, b) in R) and (pair(b, c) in S)$.
  - From $pair(b, c) in S$ and $pair(c, d) in T$, we have:
    $pair(b, d) in S rel(";") T$.
  - From $pair(a, b) in R$ and $pair(b, d) in S rel(";") T$, we have:
    $pair(a, d) in R rel(";") (S rel(";") T)$.

  *($supset.eq$):*
  Let $pair(a, d) in R rel(";") (S rel(";") T)$.
  - By definition of composition:
    $exists b in B. thin (pair(a, b) in R) and (pair(b, d) in S rel(";") T)$.
  - Since $pair(b, d) in S rel(";") T$, we have:
    $exists c in C. thin (pair(b, c) in S) and (pair(c, d) in T)$.
  - From $pair(a, b) in R$ and $pair(b, c) in S$, we have:
    $pair(a, c) in R rel(";") S$.
  - From $pair(a, c) in R rel(";") S$ and $pair(c, d) in T$, we have:
    $pair(a, d) in (R rel(";") S) rel(";") T$.

  Therefore, $(R rel(";") S) rel(";") T = R rel(";") (S rel(";") T)$.

== Definition of a Function

#definition[
  A _function_ $f$ from a set $A$ to a set $B$, denoted $f: A to B$, is a special kind of relation $f subset.eq A times B$ where every element of $A$ is paired with _exactly one_ element of $B$.

  This means two conditions must hold:
  + _Functional (left-total)_:
    For every $a in A$, there is _at least one_ pair $pair(a, b)$ in $f$.
    $ forall a in A, exists b in B: pair(a, b) in f $
  + _Serial (right-unique)_:
    For every $a in A$, there is _at most one_ pair $pair(a, b)$ in $f$.
    $ (pair(a, b_1) in f and pair(a, b_2) in f) ==> b_1 = b_2 $
]

#definition[
  A relation that satisfies the functional (left-total) property is called a _partial function_.

  A relation that satisfies _both_ properties is called a _total function_, or simply a _function_.
]

== Domain, Codomain, Range

#definition[
  For a function $f: A to B$:
  - The set $A$ is called the _domain_ of $f$, denoted $Dom(f)$.
  - The set $B$ is called the _codomain_ of $f$, denoted $Cod(f)$.
  - The _range_ (or _image_) of $f$ is the set of all values that $f$ actually takes:
    $ Range(f) = { b in B | exists a in A, f(a) = b } = { f(a) | a in A } $

    #note[
      $Range(f) subset.eq Cod(f)$
    ]
]

#example[
  Let $A = {1, 2, 3}$ and $B = {x, y, z}$.
  Let $f = {pair(1, x), pair(2, y), pair(3, x)}$.
  - $f$ is a function from $A$ to $B$.
  - $Dom(f) = A$
  - $Cod(f) = B$
  - $Range(f) = {x, y} subset.eq B$
  We have $f(1) = x$, $f(2) = y$, $f(3) = x$.

== Surjective Functions

#definition[
  A function $f: A to B$ is _surjective_ (or _onto_) if every element in the codomain is the image of at least one element in the domain.
  Formally:
  $
    forall b in B. thin exists a in A. thin f(a) = b
  $

  For surjective functions, $Range(f) = Cod(f)$, i.e., there are _no "uncovered"_ elements in the right side.

#example[

]

== Bijective Functions

#definition[
  A function $f: A to B$ is _bijective_ if it is both injective and surjective.
  A bijective function establishes a _one-to-one correspondence_ between the elements of $A$ and $B$.
]

#example[
  $f: RR to RR$ defined by $f(x) = 2x + 1$ is bijective.
  - Injective: If $2x_1+1 = 2x_2+1$, then $2x_1 = 2x_2$, so $x_1=x_2$.
  - Surjective: For any $y in RR$, let $x = (y-1) / 2$. Then $f(x) = 2((y-1) / 2) + 1 = y-1+1 = y$.
]
#example[
  The identity function $id_A: A to A$ defined by $id_A(x) = x$ for all $x in A$ is bijective.
]

== Function Composition

#definition[
  Let $f: A to B$ and $g: B to C$ be two functions.
  The _composition_ of $g$ and $f$, denoted $g compose f$ (read as "$g$ composed with $f$" or "$g$ after $f$"), is a function from $A$ to $C$ defined by:
  $
    (g compose f)(a) = g(f(a))
  $
  // for all $a in A$.
]

#example[
  Let $f: RR to RR$ be $f(x) = x^2$ and $g: RR to RR$ be $g(x) = x+1$.
  - $(g compose f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(x^2) = x^2 + 1$.
  - $(f compose g)(x) = f(g(x)) = f(x+1) = (x+1)^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1$.
]

// TODO: functional powers
// (if Y subset.eq X, then f:X->Y can be composed with itself)

== Properties of Function Composition

- _Associativity:_ If $f: A to B$, $g: B to C$, and $h: C to D$, then $(h compose g) compose f = h compose (g compose f)$.

- The _identity_ function acts as a _neutral_ element for composition:
  - $id_B compose f = f$ for any function $f: A to B$.
  - $f compose id_A = f$ for any function $f: A to B$.

- Composition _preserves_ the properties of functions:
  - If $f$ and $g$ are injective, so is $g compose f$.
  - If $f$ and $g$ are surjective, so is $g compose f$.
  - If $f$ and $g$ are bijective, so is $g compose f$.

- Note that in general, $g compose f != f compose g$, i.e., function composition is _not commutative_.

== Inverse Functions

#definition[
  If $f: A to B$ is a bijective function, then its _inverse function_, denoted $f^(-1): B to A$, is defined as:
  $
    f^(-1)(b) = a quad "iff" quad f(a) = b
  $
]

#note[
  A function has an inverse _if and only if_ it is bijective.
]

#example[
  Let $f: RR to RR$ be $f(x) = 2x + 1$.
  We found it's bijective.
  To find $f^(-1)(y)$, let $y = 2x+1$.
  Solving for $x$, we get $x = (y-1) / 2$.
  So, $f^(-1)(y) = (y-1) / 2$.
]

#theorem[
  If $f: A to B$ is a bijective function with inverse $f^(-1): B to A$:
  - $f^(-1)$ is also bijective.
  - $(f^(-1) compose f)(a) = a$ for all $a in A$ (i.e., $f^(-1) compose f = id_A$).
  - $(f compose f^(-1))(b) = b$ for all $b in B$ (i.e., $f compose f^(-1) = id_B$).
  - If $f: A to B$ and $g: B to C$ are both bijective, then $(g compose f)^(-1) = f^(-1) compose g^(-1)$.
]

== Image and Preimage of Sets

#definition[
  Let $f: A to B$ be a function and let $S subset.eq A$.
  The _image of $S$ under $f$_ is the set:
  $ f(S) = { f(s) | s in S } $
  Note that $f(S) subset.eq B$.
  The range of $f$ is $f(A)$.
]

#definition[
  Let $f: A to B$ be a function and let $T subset.eq B$.
  The _preimage of $T$ under $f$_ (or _inverse image of $T$_) is the set of all elements in the domain that map into $T$:
  $ f^(-1)(T) = { a in A | f(a) in T } $
]

#note[
  The notation $f^(-1)(T)$ is used even if the inverse function $f^(-1)$ does not exist (i.e., if $f$ is not bijective).
  It always refers to the set of domain elements that map into $T$.
]

#pagebreak()

#example[
  Let $f: ZZ -> ZZ$ be $f(x) = x^2$.
  - Let $S = {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}$. Then $f(S) = {f(-2), f(-1), f(0), f(1), f(2)} = {4, 1, 0, 1, 4} = {0, 1, 4}$.
  - Let $T_1 = {1, 9}$. The preimage is $f^(-1)(T_1) = {x in ZZ | x^2 in {1, 9}} = {-3, -1, 1, 3}$.
  - Let $T_2 = {2, 3}$. The preimage is $f^(-1)(T_2) = {x in ZZ | x^2 in {2, 3}} = emptyset$.

  - $abs(power({1,2,#emoji.cat})) = 2^3 = 8$, since the power set consists of _all 8 possible subsets_ of ${1, 2, #emoji.cat}$.

]

// TODO: proposition
#theorem[

]

#proof[
  Let $A$, $B$, $C$ be sets.
  - _Reflexivity:_
    The identity map $id_A: A to A$, where $id_A (x) = x$, is a bijection, so $A equinumerous A$.
  - _Symmetry:_
    Suppose $A equinumerous B$, then there is a bijection $f: A to B$.
    Since it is a bijection, its inverse $f^(-1)$ exists and is also a bijection.
    Hence, $f^(-1): B to A$ is a bijection, so $B equinumerous A$.
  - _Transitivity:_
    Suppose that $A equinumerous B$ and $B equinumerous C$, i.e., there are bijections $f: A to B$ and $g: B to C$.
    Then~the composition $g compose f: A to C$ is also a bijection.
    So $A equinumerous C$.

== Uncountable Sets

#definition[
  A set is _uncountable_ if it is not countable.
]

In order to prove that a set $A$ is _uncountable_, we need to show that _no bijection $NN to A$ can exist_.

The general strategy for showing that is to use _Cantor's diagonal argument_.
Given a list of elements of $A$, say $x_1, x_2, dots$ (enumerated by natural numbers), we construct a _new_ element of $A$ that _differs_ from each $x_i$, thus showing that the list cannot be complete, and hence no bijection can exist.

#theorem[
  $B^omega$ is uncountable.
]

#proof[
  Recall that $BB^omega$ is the set of all _infinite sequences_ of elements from $BB = {0, 1}$. \
  For example, $BB^omega$ contains sequences like $0000dots$, $010101dots$, $1110dots$, etc.

  Suppose for contradiction that $BB^omega$ is countable.
  Then we can _enumerate_ its elements as $x_1, x_2, dots$, where each $x_i$ is an infinite sequence of bits, so we can represent it as $x_i = (b_(i 1), b_(i 2), b_(i 3), dots)$, where $b_(i j) in BB$ is the $j$-th bit of the $i$-th sequence.

  Now we construct a new sequence $Delta = (overline(b)_(1 1), overline(b)_(2 2), overline(b)_(3 3), dots)$, where $overline(b)_(i i) = 1 - b_(i i)$, i.e., we flip the $i$-th bit of the $i$-th sequence.
  This sequence _differs_ from each $x_i$ at least in the $i$-th position, so it cannot be equal to any $x_i$, so it is _not in_ the enumeration $x_1, x_2, dots$.

  #grid(
    columns: 5,
    align: center,
    inset: 5pt,
    stroke: (x, y) => if x == 0 { (right: .8pt) } + if y == 0 { (bottom: .8pt) },
    [], $1$, $2$, $3$, $dots$,
    $x_1$, $bold(b_(1 1))$, $b_(1 2)$, $b_(1 3)$, $dots$,
    $x_2$, $b_(2 1)$, $bold(b_(2 2))$, $b_(2 3)$, $dots$,
    $x_3$, $b_(3 1)$, $b_(3 2)$, $bold(b_(3 3))$, $dots$,
    $dots.v$, $dots.v$, $dots.v$, $dots.v$, $dots.down$,
    $Delta$, $overline(b)_(1 1)$, $overline(b)_(2 2)$, $overline(b)_(3 3)$, $dots$,
  )

  Since $Delta$ is constructed from the bits, it is also an _element_ of $BB^omega$.
  Thus, we have found an element of $BB^omega$ that is not in the enumeration $x_1, x_2, dots$, contradicting the assumption that $BB^omega$ is countable.
]

== Sets of Different Sizes

#definition[
  The cardinality of a set $A$ is _less than or the same_ as the cardinality of a set $B$, denoted $abs(A) <= abs(B)$ or $A smaller.eq B$, if there is an _injection_ (one-to-one function) from $A$ to $B$.
  // Set $A$ is _no larger than_ $B$, denoted $A smaller.eq B$, iff there is an _injection_ from $A$ to $B$.
]

#definition[
  Set $A$ is _smaller_ than $B$, denoted $abs(A) < abs(B)$ or $A smaller B$, iff there is an _injection_, but _no~bijection_ from $A$ to $B$, i.e., $A smaller.eq B$ and $A equinumerous.not B$.
]

#note[
  Using this notation, we can say that a set $X$ is _countable_ iff $X smaller.eq NN$, and _uncountable_ iff $NN smaller X$.
]

#example[
  ${1, 2} smaller {a, b, c}$, since there is an injection $f: {1, 2} to {a, b, c}$ defined by $f(1) = a$ and $f(2) = b$, but no bijection exists.
]

#example[
  $NN smaller.eq ZZ$, since there is bijection (and thus an injection) $f: NN to ZZ$.
]

#example[
  $ZZ smaller.eq NN$, since there is bijection (and thus an injection) $f: ZZ to NN$.
]

#example[
  $NN smaller power(NN)$, since there is an injection $f(x) = {x}$, but no bijection exists.
]

== Cantor's Theorem

#theorem[Cantor][
  $A smaller power(A)$, for any set $A$.
]

#proof[
  The map $f(x) = {x}$ is an injection $f: A to power(A)$, since if $x != y$, then also ${x} != {y}$ by extensionality, and so $f(x) != f(y)$.
  So we have that $A smaller.eq power(A)$.

  It remains to show that $A equinumerous.not B$.
  For reductio, suppose $A equinumerous B$, i.e., there is some bijection $g: A to B$.
  Now~consider $D = {x in A | x notin g(x)}$.
  Note that $D subset.eq A$, so $D in power(A)$.
  Since $g$ is a bijection, there exists some $y in A$ such that $g(y) = D$.
  But now we have
  $
    y in g(y) "iff" y in D "iff" y notin g(y)
  $
  This is a contradiction, since $y$ cannot be both _in_ and _not in_ $g(y)$.
  Thus, $A equinumerous.not power(A)$.

#proof[#footnote[See https://math.stackexchange.com/a/183383 for more detailed analysis.]][
  Consider the function $f: L to S$ defined by $f(x) = (x, x)$.
  This is an injection, since if #box[$f(a) = f(b)$], then $(a, a) = (b, b)$, so $a = b$.
  Thus, $L smaller.eq S$.

  Now consider the function $g: S to L$ that maps $(x, y)$ to the real number obtained by _interleaving_ the decimal expansions of $x$ and $y$.
  #v(-.5em)

    cases(
      reverse: #true,

    g(x, y) & = 0.#Blue($x_1$) #Green($y_1$) #Blue($x_2$) #Green($y_2$) #Blue($x_3$) #Green($y_3$) dots
  $
  #v(-.5em)
  This is an injection, since if $g(a, b) = g(c, d)$, then $a_n = c_n$ and $b_n = d_n$ for all $n in NN$, so $(a, b) = (c, d)$.
  Thus, $S smaller.eq L$.

  By SchrÃ¶der--Bernstein (@shroder-bernstein), we have that $L equinumerous S$.

  Greatest (top) and least (bottom) elements are _unique_ when they exist.
]

#examples[
  - $pair(power(A), subset.eq)$: least $emptyset$, greatest $A$.
  - $pair(NN^+, |)$: least $1$, no greatest element.
  - $pair(ZZ, <=)$: no least or greatest element.

== Upper and Lower Bounds

// Upper bound
#definition[
  In a poset $pair(S, leq)$, an element $u in S$ is called an _upper bound_ of a subset $C subset.eq S$ if it is greater than or equal to every element in $C$, i.e., for all $x in C$, $x leq u$.
]

// Lower bound
#definition[
  In a poset $pair(S, leq)$, an element $l in S$ is called a _lower bound_ of a subset $C subset.eq S$ if it is less~than or equal to every element in $C$, i.e., for all $x in C$, $l leq x$.
]

#examples[
  - In $pair(RR, <=)$ for interval $C = (0,1)$: every $x <= 0$ is a lower bound; every $x >= 1$ an upper bound.
  - In $pair(power(A), subset.eq)$ for $C = {{1,2},{1,3}}$: lower bounds include ${1}$, $emptyset$; upper bounds include ${1,2,3}$.
  - In $pair(ZZ, |)$ for $C = {4,6}$: upper bounds are multiples of $12$; least upper bound $12$; lower bounds are divisors of $2$; greatest lower bound $2$.
]

== Suprema and Infima

// Supremum
#definition[
  In a poset $pair(S, leq)$, the _supremum_ (or _join_) of a subset $C subset.eq S$, denoted $sup(C)$ or $Join.big C$, is the _least upper bound_ of $C$, i.e., an upper bound $u in S$ s.t. for any other upper bound $v in S$, $u leq v$.

  #note[
    If it exists, the least upper bound is _unique_.
  ]
]

// Infimum
#definition[
  In a poset $pair(S, leq)$, the _infimum_ (or _meet_) of a subset $C subset.eq S$, denoted $inf(C)$ or $Meet.big C$, is the _greatest lower bound_ of $C$, i.e., a lower bound $l in S$ s.t. for any other lower bound $m in S$, $m leq l$.

  #note[
    If it exists, the greatest lower bound is _unique_.
  ]
]

#examples[
  - $pair(RR, <=)$: $sup({0,1}) = 1$, $inf({0,1}) = 0$, i.e., $sup(C) = max(C)$, $inf(C) = min(C)$.
  - $pair(power(A), subset.eq)$: $sup = union$, $inf = intersect$.
  - Divisibility on $NN_(>0)$: $sup {a, b} = lcm(a, b)$ (if any common multiple), $inf {a, b} = gcd(a, b)$.
]

== Lattices

// Upper semilattice
#definition[
  A poset $pair(S, leq)$ where every non-empty finite subset $C subset.eq S$ has a join (supremum) is called an _upper semilattice_ (or _join-semilattice_) and denoted $pair(S, Join)$.
]

// Lower semilattice
#definition[
  A poset $pair(S, leq)$ where every non-empty finite subset $C subset.eq S$ has a meet (infimum) is called a _lower semilattice_ (or _meet-semilattice_) and denoted $pair(S, Meet)$.
]

// Lattice
#definition[
  A poset $pair(S, leq)$ that is both an upper semilattice and a lower semilattice, i.e., every non-empty finite subset has both a join and a meet, is called a _lattice_, denoted $(S, Join, Meet)$.

  *Why study lattices?*
  Whenever you have:
  - Elements that can be _compared_ (ordered)
  - Ways to _combine_ elements (join, meet)
  - Consistent behavior under combination

  ...you likely have a lattice!
  This structure appears in programming languages, databases, security systems, logic circuits, and many other areas of computer science and mathematics.

== Properties of Lattices

#definition[
  A lattice is _bounded_ if it has a greatest element $top$ and a least element $bot$.
]

#definition[
  A lattice is _distributive_ if $x Meet (y Join z) = (x Meet y) Join (x Meet z)$ (and dually).
]

#definition[
  A lattice is _modular_ if $x leq z$ implies $x Join (y Meet z) = (x Join y) Meet z$.

  #note[
    Distributive $=>$ modular.
  ]
]

#example[Powerset Lattice][
  $pair(power(A), subset.eq)$ is a bounded distributive lattice with $Join = union$, $Meet = intersect$, $top = A$, $bot = emptyset$.

    )
  ]

  *Why this matters:*
  This is the foundation of set-based reasoning in:
  - Database theory (relational algebra)
  - Formal specification languages (Z, B-method)
  - Model checking and verification
]

== Examples of Lattices

// #example[
//   Subspaces of a vector space (ordered by inclusion) form a modular (not always distributive) lattice.

//   *Application:* Linear algebra, quantum mechanics (state spaces), signal processing (subspace methods).
// ]

#example[Divisibility Lattice][
  For positive integers, $a leq b$ iff $a$ divides $b$.
  - Join: Least Common Multiple (LCM)
  - Meet: Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
  - Used in: Number theory, cryptography (RSA), computer algebra systems
]

#example[Partition Lattice][
  All partitions of a set $S$, ordered by refinement.
  - $pi_1 leq pi_2$ if $pi_1$ is a refinement of $pi_2$ (smaller blocks)
  - Join: Coarsest common refinement
  - Meet: Finest common coarsening
  - Applications: Clustering, database normalization

== Why Lattices Matter [1]: Information Security Levels

#place(top + right)[
  #import fletcher: diagram, edge, node
  #diagram(
    spacing: 16pt,
    edge-stroke: 1pt + navy,
    node-corner-radius: 2pt,

    edge("-}>"),
    blob((0, -4), [Top Secret], tint: purple, name: <top-secret>),
  )
]

#example[
  In computer security, information has _classification levels_ forming a lattice:

  - Elements: ${"Public", "Internal", "Confidential", "Secret", "Top Secret"}$
  - Order: $"Public" leq "Internal" leq "Confidential" leq "Secret" leq "Top Secret"$
  - Join ($Join$): Higher classification needed to combine information
  - Meet ($Meet$): Lower classification that both pieces can be declassified to

  For instance:
  - $"Internal" Join "Confidential" = "Confidential"$ (combination needs higher level)
  - $"Secret" Meet "Confidential" = "Confidential"$ (both can be declassified to this level)
]

== Why Lattices Matter [2]: Program Analysis and Type Systems

#example[
  In programming language theory, _types_ form lattices:

  *Subtype Lattice:*
  - Order: $#`int` subset.sq.eq #`number` subset.sq.eq #`any`$, $#`string` subset.sq.eq #`any`$
  - Join: Most general common supertype (for union types)
  - Meet: Most specific common subtype (for intersection types)

  *Control Flow Analysis:*
  - Elements: Sets of possible program states
  - Order: Subset inclusion ($subset.eq$)
  - Join: Union of possible states (at merge points)
  - Meet: Intersection of guaranteed properties
]

== Why Lattices Matter [3]: Database Query Optimization

#example[
  _Query execution plans_ form a lattice:

  - Elements: Different ways to execute a query
  - Order: "Plan A $leq$ Plan B" if A is more efficient than B
  - Join: Combine optimization strategies
  - Meet: Find common optimizations

  This structure helps database optimizers systematically explore the space of possible query plans.
]

== Why Lattices Matter [4]: Concept Hierarchies and Ontologies

#example[
  Knowledge representation uses _concept lattices_.

  For example, consider a biological taxonomy:
  #block[
    #import fletcher: diagram, edge, node
    #diagram(
      spacing: (1em, 2em),
      node-fill: luma(240),
      node-stroke: 0.5pt,
      edge-stroke: 1pt,
      node((.5, 0), [Animal], name: <animal>),
      node((0, 1), [Mammal], name: <mammal>),
      node((1, 1), [Bird], name: <bird>),
      node((0, 2), [Dog], name: <dog>),
      node((1, 2), [Eagle], name: <eagle>),
      edge(<mammal>, <animal>, "-}>"),
      edge(<bird>, <animal>, "-}>"),
      edge(<dog>, <mammal>, "-}>"),
      edge(<eagle>, <bird>, "-}>"),
    )
  ]

  - Elements: Biological concepts (e.g., Animal, Mammal, Dog)
  - Order: "Concept A $leq$ Concept B" if A is a more specific type of B, e.g., "Dog $leq$ Mammal"
  - Join: Most specific common ancestor, e.g., "Mammal $Join$ Bird $=$ Animal"
  - Meet: Most general common descendant, e.g., "Bird $Meet$ Eagle $=$ Eagle"
]

== Why Lattices Matter [5]: Distributed Systems and Causality

#example[
  In distributed systems, _events_ form a lattice _under causality_:

  - Elements: System events with vector timestamps
  - Order: "Event A $leq$ Event B" if A causally precedes B
  - Join: Latest information from both events
  - Meet: Common causal history

  This structure is crucial for:
  - Consistent distributed databases
  - Version control systems (Git DAG)
  - Blockchain consensus algorithms
]

== Why Lattices Matter [6]: Logic and Boolean Reasoning

#example[
  _Propositional formulas_ form lattices:

  - Elements: Boolean formulas over variables
  - Order: $phi leq psi$ if $phi$ implies $psi$ (semantic entailment)
  - Join: Disjunction ($or$) --- weaker condition
  - Meet: Conjunction ($and$) --- stronger condition

  Special case: _Boolean algebra_ $(True, False, or, and, not)$ used in:
  - Digital circuit design
  - Database query languages (SQL WHERE clauses)
  - Search engines (Boolean search)
]
