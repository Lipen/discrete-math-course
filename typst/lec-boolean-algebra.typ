== From Algebra to Digital Circuits

#Block(color: teal)[
  #set par(justify: true)
  *Historical context:* #h(0.2em)
  George Boole's _Laws of Thought_ (1854) created an algebraic system for logic a century before electronic computers.
  In 1937, Claude Shannon's Master's thesis demonstrated that Boolean algebra could systematically design switching circuits.
  This connection became the theoretical foundation for all digital computation.
]

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Core principle:* Boolean algebra operates on truth values ($0$ and $1$) using operations like AND, OR, and NOT.
  This binary structure maps directly to physical switches, voltage levels, and logical decisions.
]

#columns(2)[
  *Timeline:*
  - *1703:* Leibniz --- binary arithmetic
  - *1854:* Boole --- algebraic logic
  - *1937:* Shannon --- circuit theory
  - *Today:* 100+ billion transistors per chip

  #colbreak()

  *Applications:*
  - Processor design (CPUs, GPUs)
  - Database queries and optimization
  - SAT solving and formal verification
  - Cryptographic algorithms
  - AI reasoning systems
]

== Boolean Values: 0 and 1

In Boolean algebra, we work with exactly two values:
- *0* (#False, off, low voltage, empty, ⊥)
- *1* (#True, on, high voltage, full, ⊤)

#example[
  In different contexts:
  - *Mathematics:* Predicate evaluation: "Is $x > 5$?" → 0 or 1
  - *Programming:* `if (user.isLoggedIn && user.hasPermission)` → boolean value
  - *Digital circuits:* Wire voltage → LOW (≈0V) or HIGH (≈3.3V)
  - *Set theory:* Characteristic function: $chi_A (x) = cases(1 "if" x in A, 0 "if" x in.not A)$
]

#Block(color: blue)[
  *Physical realization:*
  Modern computers represent all data using binary encoding.
  The two-valued logic maps naturally to physical systems: transistor states (on/off), voltage levels (high/low), magnetic orientation (north/south).
  Boolean algebra provides the mathematics for manipulating these binary representations.

#focus-slide()

== The Language of Boolean Logic

Just like natural languages have words and grammar rules, Boolean algebra has its own building blocks and composition rules.

#columns(2)[
  *Natural Language:*
  - Words: "cat", "dog"
  - Connectors: "and", "or", "not"
  - Sentences: "Cat is black and dog is not white"

  #colbreak()

  *Boolean Algebra:*
  - Variables: $x$, $y$
  - Operations: $and$, $or$, $not$
  - Expressions: $x and not y$
]

#Block(color: blue)[
  *Goal:*
  Learn the "grammar" of Boolean logic --- how to write and read Boolean expressions that represent logical relationships.
]

== Boolean Variables: The Atoms

#definition[
  A _Boolean variable_ is a variable that can take only one of two values: $0$ (false) or $1$ (true).
]

Think of Boolean variables as yes/no questions:

#example[
  Real-world Boolean variables (in programming):
  - `is_logged_in` --- Is the user logged in? (yes/no)
  - `has_permission` --- Does user have permission? (yes/no)
  - `sensor_triggered` --- Did the sensor activate? (yes/no)
  - $x > 5$ --- Is $x$ greater than 5? (true/false)
]

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Why binary?*
  Digital circuits use voltage levels (high/low), making binary the natural choice for computation.
  Every piece of data in your computer is ultimately represented as 0s and 1s.
]

== Boolean Operations: Connecting Ideas

We combine Boolean variables using operations (connectives) to express complex logic:

#definition[
  Basic Boolean operations:
  - *NOT* ($not x$ or $overline(x)$) --- negation (reverses the value)
  - *AND* ($x and y$ or $x dot y$) --- conjunction (true only if both are true)
  - *OR* ($x or y$ or $x + y$) --- disjunction (true if at least one is true)
]

#example[Access control policy][
  Database query: `SELECT * FROM users WHERE (is_admin OR has_permission) AND NOT is_banned`

  Boolean expression: $(x or y) and not z$

  This pattern appears in:
  - Authentication systems (checking multiple credentials)
  - File permissions (read AND write access)
  - Network firewalls (allow/deny rules)
  - Compiler optimization (conditional evaluation)
]

#Block(color: orange)[
  *Note:* In Boolean logic, OR is _inclusive_ (allows both to be true).
  The expression $x or y$ means "at least one," possibly both.
]

== Derived Operations: Building Blocks

More complex operations built from the basic three:

#definition[
  Derived Boolean operations:
  - *XOR* ($x xor y$): exclusive OR (true if exactly one is true)
    - Formula: $(x and not y) or (not x and y)$
    - Applications: error detection, encryption, bit manipulation

  - *Implication* ($x imply y$): "if $x$ then $y$"
    - Formula: $not x or y$
    - Applications: formal logic, theorem proving, constraint solving

  - *Equivalence* ($x iff y$): biconditional (true when values match)
    - Formula: $(x imply y) and (y imply x)$
    - Applications: equality testing, synchronization
]

#example[
  XOR in computing:
  - Parity checking: $p = x_1 xor x_2 xor dots.h.c xor x_n$
  - Encryption: $c = m xor k$ (message XOR key)
  - Variable swap: `x ^= y; y ^= x; x ^= y`
  - Hash functions: mixing bits without bias
]

== Building Boolean Expressions

#definition[
  A _Boolean expression_ is built recursively from variables and operations:
  + Variables ($x, y, z$) and constants ($0, 1$) are expressions
  + If $f$ and $g$ are expressions, so are: $not f$, $f and g$, $f or g$, $f xor g$, $f imply g$, $f iff g$
]

#example[
  Progressive complexity:
  + $x$ --- atomic variable
  + $not x$ --- negation
  + $x and y$ --- two variables connected
  + $(x and y) or z$ --- nested expression
  + $not (x or (y and z))$ --- deeply nested
  + $(x imply y) and (y imply z)$ --- transitivity pattern
]

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Key idea:*
  Operations work on _any_ expressions, not just variables.
  This compositionality lets us build arbitrarily complex formulas.
]

== Truth Tables

#definition[
  A _truth table_ is a complete list of all possible input combinations for a Boolean expression and their corresponding output values.
]

#note[
  For $n$ Boolean variables, there are $2^n$ possible input combinations.
]

#example[
  Truth table for AND operation ($x and y$):

  #align(center)[
    #table(
      columns: 3,
      stroke: (x, y) => if y == 0 { (bottom: 0.8pt) },
      table.header([*$x$*], [*$y$*], [*$x and y$*]),
      [0], [0], [0],
      [0], [1], [0],
      [1], [0], [0],
      [1], [1], [1],
    )
  ]
]

== Truth Tables for Compound Expressions

We can build truth tables for complex expressions step by step.

#example[
  Truth table for $(x and y) or (not x and z)$:

  // TODO: replace intermediate columns for sub-formulas with a single multi-column expression
  #align(center)[
    #table(
      columns: 6,
      stroke: (x, y) => if y == 0 { (bottom: 0.8pt) },
      inset: (x, y) => if y == 0 { 5pt } else { 3pt },
      table.header([*$x$*], [*$y$*], [*$z$*], [*$x and y$*], [*$not x and z$*], [*$(x and y) or (not x and z)$*]),
      [0], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0],
      [0], [0], [1], [0], [1], [1],
      [0], [1], [0], [0], [0], [0],
      [0], [1], [1], [0], [1], [1],
      table.hline(stroke: 0.4pt + gray),
      [1], [0], [0], [0], [0], [0],
      [1], [0], [1], [0], [0], [0],
      [1], [1], [0], [1], [0], [1],
      [1], [1], [1], [1], [0], [1],
      table.hline(stroke: 0.4pt + gray),
    )
  ]
]

#Block(color: blue)[
  *Method:* Build intermediate columns for subexpressions, then combine them for the final result.
]

== Tautologies, Contradictions, Contingencies

#definition[
  - A _tautology_ is a Boolean expression that is always true (all 1s in output column)
  - A _contradiction_ is a Boolean expression that is always false (all 0s in output column)
  - A _contingency_ is a Boolean expression that is sometimes true and sometimes false
]

#example[
  - *Tautology:* $x or not x$ (law of excluded middle)
  - *Contradiction:* $x and not x$ (law of non-contradiction)
  - *Contingency:* $x and y$ (depends on values of $x$ and $y$)
]

#Block(color: orange)[
  *Warning:* In Boolean algebra, we typically care about expressions that are contingencies---those that represent actual functions. Tautologies and contradictions are constant functions.
]

== Logical Equivalence

#definition[
  Two Boolean expressions $f$ and $g$ are _logically equivalent_ (written $f equiv g$) if they have identical truth tables---they produce the same output for every possible input combination.
]

#example[
  Show that $not (x and y) equiv not x or not y$ (De Morgan's law):

  #align(center)[
    #table(
      columns: 5,
      stroke: (x, y) => if y == 0 { (bottom: 0.8pt) },
      inset: (x, y) => if y == 0 { 5pt } else { 3pt },
      table.header([*$x$*], [*$y$*], [*$not (x and y)$*], [*$not x or not y$*], [*Equal?*]),
      [0], [0], [1], [1], [#YES],
      [0], [1], [1], [1], [#YES],
      [1], [0], [1], [1], [#YES],
      [1], [1], [0], [0], [#YES],
    )
  ]

  Since all rows match, $not (x and y) equiv not x or not y$.
  #h(1fr) $qed$
]

== Evaluating Boolean Expressions

Given values for all variables, we can evaluate any Boolean expression.

#example[
  Evaluate $f(x, y, z) = (x or y) and (not x or z)$ when $x = 1, y = 0, z = 1$:

  $
    f(1, 0, 1) & = (1 or 0) and (not 1 or 1) \
               & = 1 and (0 or 1) \
               & = 1 and 1 \
               & = 1
  $
]

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Practice skill:* Being able to quickly evaluate Boolean expressions is essential for debugging circuits and verifying logical designs.
]

== Simplifying Boolean Expressions

Simple algebraic manipulation can simplify expressions:

#example[
  Simplify $f(x, y) = (x and y) or (x and not y)$:

  $
    f(x, y) & = (x and y) or (x and not y) \
            & = x and (y or not y)         & quad & "(distributivity)" \
            & = x and 1                    & quad & "(excluded middle)" \
            & = x                          & quad & "(identity)"
  $
]

#example[
  Simplify $g(x, y, z) = (x or y) and (x or not y)$:

  $
    g(x, y, z) & = (x or y) and (x or not y) \
               & = x or (y and not y)        & quad & "(distributivity)" \
               & = x or 0                    & quad & "(contradiction)" \
               & = x                         & quad & "(identity)"
  $
]

#focus-slide()

== From Expressions to Algebraic Structure

We have seen Boolean expressions as formulas.
Now we study their _algebraic structure_: the operations and laws that govern how they behave.

#Block(color: blue)[
  *Why formalize?*
  Just as group theory abstracts the common structure of numbers, symmetries, and transformations, Boolean algebra abstracts the structure of logic, sets, and circuits.
]

#columns(2)[
  *What we already have:*
  - Variables and constants
  - Operations: $not$, $and$, $or$
  - Expressions
  - Truth tables

  #colbreak()

  *What we'll add:*

  - Fundamental laws
  - Proof techniques
  - Connection to lattices
]

== Boolean Algebra: Formal Definition

#definition[
  A _Boolean algebra_ is a set $B$ with:
  - Two binary operations: $or$ (join) and $and$ (meet)
  - One unary operation: $not$ (complement)
  - Two special elements: $0$ (bottom) and $1$ (top)

  satisfying the axioms on the next slide.
]

#example[
  The two-element Boolean algebra ${0, 1}$ with:
  - $0 or 0 = 0$, $0 or 1 = 1$, $1 or 0 = 1$, $1 or 1 = 1$
  - $0 and 0 = 0$, $0 and 1 = 0$, $1 and 0 = 0$, $1 and 1 = 1$
  - $not 0 = 1$, $not 1 = 0$
]

== Boolean Algebra Axioms


#definition[Axioms of Boolean Algebra][
  For all $x, y, z in B$:
  + *Commutativity:* $x or y = y or x$ and $x and y = y and x$
  + *Associativity:* $(x or y) or z = x or (y or z)$ and $(x and y) and z = x and (y and z)$
  + *Distributivity:* $x and (y or z) = (x and y) or (x and z)$ and $x or (y and z) = (x or y) and (x or z)$
  + *Identity:* $x or 0 = x$ and $x and 1 = x$
  + *Complement:* $x or not x = 1$ and $x and not x = 0$
]

#note[
  Both $and$ and $or$ distribute over each other --- this is special to Boolean algebra (unlike ordinary arithmetic where only $times$ distributes over $+$).
]

== Examples of Boolean Algebras

#example[Power Set][
  For any set $A$, $(power(A), union, intersect, not, emptyset, A)$ is a Boolean algebra:
  - Join: $union$ (union)
  - Meet: $intersect$ (intersection)
  - Complement: $X^c = A setminus X$
  - Bottom: $emptyset$, Top: $A$
]

#example[Binary Strings][
  For $n$-bit binary strings with bitwise operations:
  - Join: bitwise OR
  - Meet: bitwise AND
  - Complement: bitwise NOT
  - Bottom: $000...0$, Top: $111...1$
]

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Key insight:* The same algebraic structure appears in logic, set theory, circuits, and more.
]

== Fundamental Laws (Derived Properties)

From the axioms, we can prove many useful identities:

#theorem[Basic Laws][
  For all $x, y in B$:
  + *Idempotence:* $x or x = x$ and $x and x = x$
  + *Absorption:* $x or (x and y) = x$ and $x and (x or y) = x$
  + *Null (Domination):* $x or 1 = 1$ and $x and 0 = 0$
  + *Double Negation:* $not not x = x$
  + *Complement of Constants:* $not 0 = 1$ and $not 1 = 0$
]

#note[
  These can all be proven from the axioms using algebraic manipulation.
]

== Proving Identities: Idempotence

#theorem[
  $x or x = x$ for all $x$ in a Boolean algebra.
]

#proof[
  $
    x or x & = (x or x) and 1            & quad & "(identity)" \
           & = (x or x) and (x or not x) & quad & "(complement)" \
           & = x or (x and not x)        & quad & "(distributivity)" \
           & = x or 0                    & quad & "(complement)" \
           & = x                         & quad & "(identity)"
  $
]

#Block(color: blue)[
  *Method:* Use axioms strategically --- introduce $1$ or $0$, apply distributivity, then simplify.
]

== Proving Identities: Absorption

#theorem[
  $x or (x and y) = x$ for all $x, y$ in a Boolean algebra.
]

#proof[
  $
    x or (x and y) & = (x and 1) or (x and y) & quad & "(identity)" \
                   & = x and (1 or y)         & quad & "(distributivity)" \
                   & = x and 1                & quad & "(null law)" \
                   & = x                      & quad & "(identity)"
  $
]

#example[
  Similarly, $x and (x or y) = x$ by dual reasoning.
]

== The Duality Principle

== Connection to Lattices

#definition[
  A _lattice_ is a partially ordered set where any two elements $x, y$ have:
  - A _least upper bound_ (join): $x Join y$
  - A _greatest lower bound_ (meet): $x Meet y$
]

#definition[
  A _bounded distributive lattice_ is a lattice with bottom $bot$, top $top$, and distributivity:
  $
    x Meet (y Join z) = (x Meet y) Join (x Meet z)
  $
]

#definition[
  A _complemented lattice_ is a bounded lattice where every element $x$ has a complement $y$ such that $x Join y = top$ and $x Meet y = bot$.
]

#theorem[
  Every Boolean algebra is a complemented bounded distributive lattice.
]

== Complement Uniqueness

#theorem[
  In a Boolean algebra, each element has a _unique_ complement.
]

#proof[
  Suppose $y$ and $z$ are both complements of $x$. Then:
  $
    y & = y and 1                & quad & "(identity)" \
      & = y and (x or z)         & quad & "(" z "is complement of" x ")" \
      & = (y and x) or (y and z) & quad & "(distributivity)" \
      & = 0 or (y and z)         & quad & "(" y "is complement of" x ")" \
      & = (x and z) or (y and z) & quad & "(" z "is complement of" x ")" \
      & = (x or y) and z         & quad & "(distributivity)" \
      & = 1 and z                & quad & "(" y "is complement of" x ")" \
      & = z                      & quad & "(identity)"
  $

  Therefore $y = z$.

== Summary of Boolean Algebra Structure

#Block(color: purple)[
  *What we've established in this section:*

  + *Algebraic structure:* Boolean algebra $angle.l B, or, and, not, 0, 1 angle.r$ with five fundamental axioms
  + *Fundamental laws:* Idempotence, absorption, De Morgan's laws all follow from axioms
  + *Duality principle:* Swap $or <=> and$ and $0 <=> 1$ to get new theorems for free
  + *Connection to lattices:* Boolean algebras are complemented bounded distributive lattices
  + *Complement uniqueness:* Each element has exactly one complement
]

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Key insight:*
  The same algebraic structure appears in logic (AND/OR/NOT), set theory ($union$, $inter$, $overline(x)$), and circuits (gates).
  This universality is why Boolean algebra is the foundation of computer science.
]

#Block(color: blue)[
  *What's next:*
  Now that we have the algebraic structure, we need systematic ways to _represent_ any Boolean function.
  This leads to normal forms (DNF, CNF) and minimization techniques (K-maps).
]


= Normal Forms
#focus-slide()

== From Structure to Representation

We've established the algebraic structure of Boolean algebra.

Now: how do we _represent_ any Boolean function systematically?

*The challenge:*
- There are $2^(2^n)$ different Boolean functions of $n$ variables
- For $n=3$: already 256 different functions!
- We need _canonical forms_ that work for ALL of them

*What we'll learn:*

#grid(
  columns: 2,
  gutter: 1em,

    - DNF (Disjunctive Normal Form)
    - CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form)

    - Circuit synthesis
    - Equivalence checking
    - Systematic simplification and minimization
  ],
)

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Goal:* Express ANY Boolean function as a combination of simple building blocks.
]

== Building Blocks: Literals

#definition[
  A _literal_ is either a Boolean variable or its negation.
]

Think of literals as the simplest meaningful statements:

#example[
  For variables $x$, $y$, $z$:
  - *Positive literals:* $x$, $y$, $z$ --- "is true"
  - *Negative literals:* $not x$, $not y$, $not z$ --- "is false"
]

#example[Real-world interpretation][
  - $x$ might mean "user is logged in"
  - $not x$ means "user is NOT logged in"
  - The expression $(x and not y) or z$ combines three literals: $x$, $not y$, and $z$
]

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Key idea:*
  Literals are the atoms of Boolean logic.
  Every complex expression is ultimately built from these simple building blocks using $and$ and $or$.
]

== Terms and Clauses

#definition[
  - A _term_ (or _product_, or _cube_) is a conjunction (AND) of literals
  - A _clause_ (or _sum_) is a disjunction (OR) of literals
]

#note[
  The term "cube" is commonly used in scientific literature for DNF components. \
  We use "term" and "cube" interchangeably, but "cube" provides a unique geometric interpretation!

== Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF)

#definition[DNF][
  A Boolean formula is in _Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF)_ if it is a disjunction (OR) of cubes.

  General form: $(c_1) or (c_2) or dots or (c_k)$ where each $c_i$ is a cube (conjunction of literals).
]

#note[
  In DNF, we use "cube" to refer to each AND-component. This terminology emphasizes the geometric interpretation and aligns with scientific literature on minimization.
]

#example[
  DNF formulas:
  - $(x and y) or (not x and z)$ --- "($x$ and $y$) OR ($not x$ and $z$)" ~(2 cubes)
  - $(x and not y and z) or (not x and y) or z$ --- three alternatives ~(3 cubes)
  - $x or (y and not z)$ --- still DNF (mixed form) ~(2 cubes: $x$ and $y and not z$)
]

#example[
  *NOT* in DNF:
  - $(x or y) and z$ --- this is CNF (AND of ORs)
  - $x and (y or z)$ --- OR nested inside AND violates DNF structure
]

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Intuition:*
  DNF says "the output is 1 if ANY of these scenarios happen," where each scenario is a specific combination of variable values.
]

== Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)

#definition[CNF][
  A Boolean formula is in _Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)_ if it is a conjunction (AND) of clauses.

  General form: $(c_1) and (c_2) and dots and (c_k)$ where each $c_i$ is a clause (disjunction of literals).
]

#example[
  CNF formulas:
  - $(x or y) and (not x or z)$ --- both constraints must hold
  - $(x or not y or z) and (not x or y) and z$ --- three constraints
  - $x and (y or not z)$ --- still CNF (mixed form)
]

#example[
  *NOT* in CNF:
  - $(x and y) or z$ --- this is DNF (OR of ANDs)
  - $x or (y and z)$ --- AND nested inside OR violates CNF structure
]

== CNF vs DNF

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Intuition:*
  CNF says "ALL of these constraints must be satisfied," where each constraint offers multiple ways to be true.

  DNF says "the output is 1 if ANY of these scenarios happen," where each scenario is a specific combination of variable values.

#Block(color: blue)[
  *Duality:*
  DNF and CNF are _dual_ forms.
  Swap $and$ and $or$ to convert between them.

== Minterms and Maxterms

#definition[
  For $n$ variables:
  - A _minterm_ is a maximal cube containing all $n$ variables (each exactly once, positive or negated)
  - A _maxterm_ is a maximal clause containing all $n$ variables (each exactly once, positive or negated)
]

#example[
  For variables $x$, $y$, $z$:
  - *Minterms:* $(x and y and z)$, $(x and y and not z)$, $(x and not y and z)$, ...
  - *Maxterms:* $(x or y or z)$, $(x or y or not z)$, $(x or not y or z)$, ...

  There are exactly $2^n = 2^3 = 8$ minterms and $8$ maxterms for $3$ variables.
]

#Block(color: blue)[
  *Key property:*
  - Each minterm is 1 for *exactly ONE* input combination
  - Each maxterm is 0 for *exactly ONE* input combination
  - This makes them perfect building blocks for representing any function!
]

== Minterm and Maxterm Indexing

We can index minterms and maxterms by their binary representations:

#example[
  For $x, y, z$ (interpreting as bits: $x y z$):

  #align(center)[
    #table(
      columns: 4,
      stroke: (x, y) => if y == 0 { (bottom: 0.8pt) },
      table.header([*Index*], [*Binary*], [*Minterm $m_i$*], [*Maxterm $M_i$*]),
      [0], [000], [$not x and not y and not z$], [$x or y or z$],
      [1], [001], [$not x and not y and z$], [$x or y or not z$],
      [2], [010], [$not x and y and not z$], [$x or not y or z$],
      [3], [011], [$not x and y and z$], [$x or not y or not z$],
      [4], [100], [$x and not y and not z$], [$not x or y or z$],
      [5], [101], [$x and not y and z$], [$not x or y or not z$],
      [6], [110], [$x and y and not z$], [$not x or not y or z$],
      [7], [111], [$x and y and z$], [$not x or not y or not z$],
    )
  ]
]

== Sum of Products (SoP)

#definition[
  A _sum of products (SoP)_ (also called _canonical sum of minterms_) is a DNF where each cube is a minterm.

  General form: $f(x_1, dots, x_n) = limits(or.big)_(i in I) m_i$ where $I subset.eq {0, 1, dots, 2^n - 1}$
]

#note[
  In SoP, each cube is _maximal_ (contains all variables). This form is unique for any given function!
]

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Recipe:* Find rows where $f = 1$ $=>$ write minterms $m_i$ $=>$ OR them together.
]

#Block(color: blue)[
  *Why it works:* Each minterm is 1 for exactly one row $=>$ OR gives 1 when ANY minterm is 1.
]

== SoP: Example

#example[
  For the function $f$ with truth table:

  #place(right, dx: -5cm, dy: -2em)[
    #table(
      columns: 4,
      align: center,
      stroke: (x, y) => if y == 0 { (bottom: 0.8pt) } + if x == 2 { (right: 0.4pt) },
      inset: (x, y) => if y == 0 { 5pt } else { 3pt },
      table.header([*$x$*], [*$y$*], [*$z$*], [*$f$*]),
      [0], [0], [0], [0],
      [0], [0], [1], [*1*],
      [0], [1], [0], [0],
      [0], [1], [1], [*1*],
      [1], [0], [0], [0],
      [1], [0], [1], [0],
      [1], [1], [0], [*1*],
      [1], [1], [1], [*1*],
    )
  ]

  *Step 1:* Identify rows where $f = 1$: rows 1, 3, 6, 7

  *Step 2:* Write corresponding minterms:
  - Row 1 (001): $m_1 = not x and not y and z$
  - Row 3 (011): $m_3 = not x and y and z$
  - Row 6 (110): $m_6 = x and y and not z$
  - Row 7 (111): $m_7 = x and y and z$

  *Step 3:* OR them together:
  $
    f & = m_1 or m_3 or m_6 or m_7 = \
      & = (not x and not y and z) or (not x and y and z) or (x and y and not z) or (x and y and z) = \
      & = overline(x) thin overline(y) z + overline(x) y z + x y overline(z) + x y z
  $
]

== Product of Sums (PoS)

#definition[
  A _product of sums (PoS)_ (also called _canonical product of maxterms_) is a CNF where each clause is a maxterm.

  General form: $f(x_1, dots, x_n) = limits(and.big)_(i in I) M_i$ where $I subset.eq {0, 1, dots, 2^n - 1}$
]

#example[
  For the *same function*, use rows where $f = 0$ (rows 0, 2, 4, 5):
  $
    f & = M_0 and M_2 and M_4 and M_5 \
      & = (x or y or z) and (x or not y or z) and (not x or y or z) and (not x or y or not z)
  $
]

#grid(
  columns: (auto, 1fr),
  column-gutter: 1em,
  Block(color: blue)[
    *Two approaches:*
    - SoP uses 1s in truth table (where function is true)
    - PoS uses 0s in truth table (where function is false)
    - Both represent the same function!
  ],
  Block(color: orange)[
    *Why PoS?*
    Sometimes PoS is more compact than SoP (when function has fewer 0s than 1s).
  ],
)

== Completeness of Normal Forms

#theorem[
  Every Boolean function can be represented in both CNF and DNF.
]

#proof[Sketch for DNF (SoP)][
  Given a truth table:
  + For each row where output is 1, create the corresponding minterm
  + OR all these minterms together
  + The result is the function in DNF (SoP form)

  *Why this works:*
  - Each minterm is 1 for exactly one input combination
  - ORing them gives 1 exactly when the function should be 1
  - This construction is always possible and always correct
]

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Power of synthesis:*
  Any Boolean function can be built from its truth table!

== Shannon Expansion

#theorem[Shannon Expansion][
  For any Boolean function $f$ and variable $x$:
  $
    f(x, y_1, dots, y_n) = (not x and f(0, y_1, dots, y_n)) or (x and f(1, y_1, dots, y_n))
  $

  $
    f(x, y_1, dots, y_n) = (x or f(0, y_1, dots, y_n)) and (not x or f(1, y_1, dots, y_n))
  $
]

#example[
  Expand $f(x, y) = x xor y$ by $x$:
  $
    f(x, y) & = (not x and f(0, y)) or (x and f(1, y)) \
            & = (not x and (0 xor y)) or (x and (1 xor y)) \
            & = (not x and y) or (x and not y)
  $

  This gives us the standard XOR representation!

== Converting Between Forms

Converting between DNF and CNF can be tricky:

#example[DNF to CNF using De Morgan's laws][
  Start with DNF: $(x and y) or (not x and z)$

  *Step-by-step:*
  + Negate: $not ((x and y) or (not x and z))$
  + Apply De Morgan: $(not (x and y)) and (not (not x and z))$
  + Apply De Morgan again: $(not x or not y) and (x or not z)$
  + Double negate to get back: $not not ((not x or not y) and (x or not z))$

  Result is CNF: $(not x or not y) and (x or not z)$
]

#Block(color: orange)[
  *Warning:*
  Direct algebraic conversion can cause exponential blowup in formula size!
  For complex functions, use Karnaugh maps or other minimization techniques.

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Alternative:*
  Build CNF/DNF directly from truth table using the SoP/PoS methods.

== Summary: Canonical Forms

#Block(color: purple)[
  *What we've learned about normal forms:*

  + *Building blocks:* Literals, cubes (AND of literals), clauses (OR of literals)

= Minimization
#focus-slide()

// TODO: use "overline" instead of "not" (not *everywhere*, but generally...), since it is easier to read. That way, "and" could be omitted, and "or" could be replaced by "+".

== The Minimization Problem

We can express _any_ Boolean function from its truth table using SoP or PoS.

But the result is often *not minimal*.

#example[
  Consider $f(x, y, z) = (not x and not y and z) or (not x and y and z) or (x and y and not z) or (x and y and z)$

  Canonical DNF: 4 terms, 12 literals total (7 gates needed).

  After minimization: $f = (not x and z) or (x and y)$ --- only 4 literals (3 gates).

  *Result:* 57% fewer gates, less power, faster operation.
]

#grid(
  columns: 2,
  column-gutter: 1em,

  Block(color: blue)[
    *Why minimize?*
    - Cheaper: Fewer gates = lower cost
    - Power: Each gate consumes energy
    - Speed: Fewer delays = faster
    - Yield: Fewer components = fewer defects
    - Verification: Simpler = easier to test
  ],

  Block(color: orange)[
    *The challenge:*
    Minimization is NP-complete.

    Practical techniques:
    - K-maps (2-5 vars)
    - Quine-McCluskey (6-8 vars)
    - ESPRESSO heuristics (100+ vars)
  ],
)

// #note[
//   - 1950s-70s: gates expensive, minimize for cost.
//   - Today: power expensive (battery, cooling), minimize for efficiency.
// ]

== What Does "Minimal" Mean?

#Block(color: green)[
  Different minimization criteria (goals) exist:
  - *Minimum literals:* Fewest total literal occurrences
  - *Minimum terms:* Fewest product terms (DNF) or clauses (CNF)
  - *Minimum gates:* Fewest logic gates in circuit
  - *Minimum levels:* Shortest signal propagation path (depth)
]

#example[
  Function: $f = A B + A C + B C$

  - Has 6 literals, 3 terms
  - Can be reduced to: $f = A B + A C$ (using consensus theorem)
  - Now 4 literals, 2 terms
]

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Usually*, we minimize the number of literals (most common criterion).
]

== Gray Code: Foundation of K-Maps

#definition[
  A _Gray code_ is a binary encoding where consecutive values differ in exactly one bit.
  This single-distance property eliminates transition errors in electromechanical systems.
]

#example[
  3-bit Gray code sequence:

  #align(center)[
    #table(

      [7], [111], [100], [bit 0],
    )
  ]
]

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *K-map connection:*
  Adjacent cells in Karnaugh maps use Gray code ordering.
  This ensures neighboring cells differ in exactly one variable, making algebraic simplification patterns visually apparent.

  *The key identity:* $(x and y) or (x and not y) = x$ #h(1em) (variable $y$ cancels out)
]

== Converting Binary and Gray Code

#Block(color: green)[
  *Binary to Gray*:
  - Keep MSB (most significant bit)
  - Each next bit: XOR current binary bit with previous binary bit

  *Gray to Binary*:
  - Keep MSB
  - Each next bit: XOR current Gray bit with previous binary bit
]

#example[
  Binary $#`1011` _2$ $to$ Gray:
  - Bit 3: $1$ (keep MSB)
  - Bit 2: $1 xor 0 = 1$
  - Bit 1: $0 xor 1 = 1$
  - Bit 0: $1 xor 1 = 0$
  - *Result:* $#`1110` _"Gray"$
]

== Introduction to Karnaugh Maps

#definition[
  A _Karnaugh map (K-map)_ is a 2D grid representation of a truth table, arranged using Gray code so that adjacent cells (including wraparound) differ in exactly one variable.
]

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Core idea:* K-maps transform algebraic minimization into visual pattern recognition.

  - Practical only for ≤6 variables
  - Manual grouping required
  - Doesn't scale to large functions
  - Use Quine-McCluskey or ESPRESSO for 6+ variables

== 2-Variable K-Map: Step by Step

#example[
  Build K-map for $f(x, y) = x or y$.

  *Step 1:* Create 2×2 grid and fill in the truth values

  #place(right, dx: -3cm)[
    #k-mapper.karnaugh(
      4,
      y-label: $x$,
      x-label: $y$,
      manual-terms: (
        kcell(0, 0),
        kcell(1, 1),
        kcell(2, 1),
        kcell(3, 1),
      ),
      implicants: ((1, 3), (2, 3)),
    )
  ]

  *Step 2:* Group adjacent 1s
  - Horizontal pair (bottom row): $x = 1$ $->$ gives term $x$
  - Vertical pair (right column): $y = 1$ $->$ gives term $y$

  *Result:* $f = x or y$
]

== 3-Variable K-Map Structure

For 3 variables, we use a 4×2 grid (two variables for rows, one for columns):

#align(center)[
  #k-mapper.karnaugh(
    8,
    y-label: $x y$,
    x-label: $z$,
    manual-terms: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7),
  )
]

#note[
  Row order: 00, 01, *11*, 10 (Gray code, NOT binary!)

  This ensures top-bottom adjacency and wrap-around (torus structure).
]

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Remember:* The map wraps around --- top and bottom rows are adjacent!
]

== 3-Variable K-Map: Complete Example

#example[
  Minimize $f(x, y, z) = sum m(1, 3, 6, 7)$:

  *Step 1:* Draw 4×2 grid and fill in the truth values

  #place(right, dx: -5cm)[
    #k-mapper.karnaugh(
      8,
      y-label: $x y$,

        kcell(0, 0),
        kcell(1, 1),
        kcell(2, 0),

        kcell(4, 0),
        kcell(5, 0),
        kcell(6, 1),
        kcell(7, 1),
      ),
      implicants: ((1, 3), (6, 7)),
    )
  ]

  *Step 2:* Identify groupings

  - #Red[Red group]:
    - Variables: $x = 0$, $z = 1$, $y$ varies
    - Term: $not x and z$

  - #Green[Green group]:
    - Variables: $x = 1$, $y = 1$, $z$ varies
    - Term: $x and y$

  *Step 3:* Write minimal DNF

  $f = (not x and z) or (x and y) = overline(x) z + x y$
]

== How K-Map Grouping Works

#Block(color: blue)[
  *Grouping principles:*
  - Variables that _change_ within the group are eliminated
  - Variables that stay _constant_ remain in the term
  - Larger groups $=>$ more variables eliminated $=>$ simpler terms
]

#example[
  Group of 2 cells in 3-var K-map:

  #align(center)[
    #table(

      [], [], [$x=0$, $z=1$, $y$ varies],
    )
  ]

  *Result:* $not x and z$ ~ ($y$ eliminated)
]

== 4-Variable K-Map Structure

For 4 variables, use a 4×4 grid with Gray code on both axes:

#align(center)[
  #k-mapper.karnaugh(
    16,
    y-label: $A B$,
    x-label: $C D$,

  )
]

#Block(color: orange)[
  *Important:*
  Both rows and columns wrap around!
  Treat the map as a _torus_:
  - Top $<==>$ Bottom are adjacent
  - Left $<==>$ Right are adjacent
  - Even corners can be grouped!

    table.header([*Group*], [*Cells*], [*Pattern*], [*Term*]),
    [Corners], [0, 2, 8, 10], [$B = 0$, $D = 0$, $A$ and $C$ vary], [$overline(B) thin overline(D)$],
    [Vertical], [5, 13], [$B = 1$, $C = 0$, $D = 1$, $A$ varies], [$B thin overline(C) thin D$],
  )

  *Minimal DNF:* $f = overline(B) thin overline(D) + B thin overline(C) thin D$
]

== K-Map Grouping: Valid Group Sizes

#Block(color: purple)[
  *Rules for valid groups:*

  + Size must be a power of 2: 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 cells
  + Shape must be rectangular (1×2, 2×2, 4×4, 1×8, etc.)
  + Can wrap around edges (torus topology)
  + Larger groups are always better (fewer literals)

1. Mark all 1s in the K-map
2. Find essential groups (cells covered by only one group)
3. Cover remaining 1s with largest rectangles (8, 4, 2, 1)
4. Use wraparound on edges and corners
5. Minimize overlap but allow if needed

== K-Maps with Don't-Care Conditions

#definition[Don't-Care Conditions][
  Situations where output value doesn't matter (marked as $cross$):
  - Invalid input combinations
  - Outputs that are never used
  - Incompletely specified functions
]

#example[
  BCD (Binary Coded Decimal) uses only 0-9:

  Inputs 1010-1111 are don't-cares (invalid BCD)
]

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Strategy with don't-cares:*
  - Treat $cross$ as 0 or 1 to maximize group sizes
  - Include $cross$ in groups if it helps
  - Don't create groups containing only $cross$ values
]

== Don't-Care Example

#example[
  Function with don't-cares at positions 9, 11, 12, 15

  #align(center)[
    #k-mapper.karnaugh(

        kcell(15, cross),
      ),
      implicants: ((1, 3), (8, 13)),
    )
  ]

  - Group 1: includes cells 1, 3 (filled with 1s) $=>$ gives $overline(A) thin overline(B) thin D$
  - Group 2: includes cells 8, 9, 12, 13 (uses don't-cares) $=>$ gives $A thin overline(C)$

  Without don't-cares, we would need more terms to cover all 1s!

== Algebraic Minimization

Beyond K-maps, we can minimize algebraically using Boolean laws:

      [Combining], [$X Y + X overline(Y) = X$], [$(X + Y)(X + overline(Y)) = X$],

      [$X Y + overline(X) Z + Y Z$ \ $= X Y + overline(X) Z$],
      [$(X + Y)(overline(X) + Z)(Y + Z)$ \ $= (X + Y)(overline(X) + Z)$],
    )
  ]
]

== Step-by-Step Algebraic Minimization

#example[
  Minimize $f = A B C + A B overline(C) + overline(A) B C + overline(A) overline(B) C$:

  *Step 1:* Look for combining opportunities
  $
    f & = A B C + A B overline(C) + overline(A) B C + overline(A) overline(B) C \
      & = A B (C + overline(C)) + overline(A) B C + overline(A) overline(B) C   & quad & "(factor)" \
      & = A B + overline(A) B C + overline(A) overline(B) C                     & quad & "(complement)"
  $

  *Step 2:* Apply more combining
  $
    f & = A B + overline(A) C (B + overline(B)) & quad & "(factor)" \
      & = A B + overline(A) C                   & quad & "(complement)"
  $

  *Final result:* $f = A B + overline(A) C$ (reduced from 12 to 4 literals!)
]

== Consensus Theorem

#theorem[Consensus Theorem][
  $X Y + overline(X) Z + Y Z = X Y + overline(X) Z$

  The term $Y Z$ is "absorbed" by the other two terms.
]

#proof[
  $
    X Y + overline(X) Z + Y Z & = X Y + overline(X) Z + (X + overline(X)) Y Z   & quad & "(complement)" \

  $
]

#note[
  *Intuition:* If $Y Z$ is true, then either $X Y$ or $overline(X) Z$ must be true, so $Y Z$ is redundant.
]

== Multi-Level Minimization

#definition[Multi-Level Logic][
  Instead of two-level SoP/PoS, use multiple levels of gates to share common subexpressions.
]

#example[
  Two-level: $f_1 = A B C + A B D$, $f_2 = A B C + A B E$

  Total: $12$ literals ($6 + 6$)

  Multi-level with factoring:
  - $T = A B$ (common factor)
  - $f_1 = T (C + D)$
  - $f_2 = T (C + E)$

  Total: $6$ literals + reuse of $T$
]

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Trade-off:* Multi-level uses fewer gates but has longer delay (more levels).

== When to Use CNF vs DNF

#columns(2)[

- $m_(6,7)$ (11−): alone with dash at pos. 2 $=>$ cannot combine #NO

*Result:*
One size-4 implicant formed: $m_(1,3,5,7)$ (−−1).
One size-2 implicant remains uncombined: $m_(6,7)$ (11−).

== Prime Implicant Chart

#definition[
  A _prime implicant chart_ is a table showing which minterms are covered by each prime implicant.
]

#note[
  Our goal in Q-M is to select a minimum set of prime implicants covering all minterms.

      [$A B$ (11−)], [], [], [], [$checkmark$], [$checkmark$],
    )

  *Finding essential prime implicants:*
  - Look for columns with only ONE $checkmark$ $=>$ that PI is *essential*
    - Columns $m_1$, $m_3$, $m_5$ --- only covered by $C$ $=>$ $C$ is *essential*
    - Column $m_6$ --- only covered by $A B$ $=>$ $A B$ is *essential*

  *Selecting minimal cover:*
  - Must include: $C$ (essential), covers ${1, 3, 5, 7}$
  - Must include: $A B$ (essential), covers ${6, 7}$

  *Minimal solution:* $f = C + A B$ (3 literals)

    ]
  ],

  Block(color: yellow)[
    *Key insight:*
    If a minterm has _only one_ $cross$, the~corresponding prime implicant is _essential_ and must be included in any minimal cover.
  ],
)

- Minterm $m_i$ is covered only by $"PI"_1$ $=>$ $"PI"_1$ is _essential_ $=>$ it _must_ be included
- Minterm $m_j$ is covered by both $"PI"_1$ and $"PI"_2$ $=>$ no EPI
- Minterm $m_k$ is covered by both $"PI"_2$ and $"PI"_3$ $=>$ no EPI

*Conclusion:* $"PI"_1$ _must_ be included. For remaining minterms, choose either $"PI"_2$ or $"PI"_3$.

== Petrick's Method

When multiple prime implicants remain after selecting essentials:

#definition[
  _Petrick's method_ finds all combinations of prime implicants that cover the remaining minterms, so you can pick the one with the lowest cost.

  + Express "covering all minterms" as a Boolean formula

  + Formula in CNF (product of sums)
  + Convert to DNF to see all possible covers

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Key insight:*
  Minimization transforms algebraic simplification into visual pattern recognition (K-maps) or systematic algorithms (Q-M).
  For small functions (≤5 vars), K-maps are instant. For large functions, we use heuristics and accept near-optimal solutions.
]

#Block(color: blue)[
  *What's next:*
  All our techniques (DNF, CNF, minimization) use AND/OR/NOT. But there's a completely different approach using only XOR and AND --- Algebraic Normal Form (ANF). This gives us _unique_ canonical representation, crucial for cryptography.
]


= Algebraic Normal Form
#focus-slide()

== Motivation: A Different Representation

All our normal forms (DNF, CNF) use AND, OR, NOT. They work great for circuits but have redundancy: the same function has infinitely many equivalent representations.

#example[
  $f = (x and y) or (x and not y) = x and (y or not y) = x and 1 = x$
]

*For cryptography and formal verification, we need a _unique_ canonical form.*

#Block(color: blue)[
  *ANF (Algebraic Normal Form):* Use only XOR ($xor$) and AND ($and$).

  Result: Every Boolean function has a _unique_ polynomial representation over $"GF"(2)$.

  Note: $overline(x) = x xor 1$, so NOT is not needed.
]

== Why ANF? Applications and Advantages

So far, we've built Boolean functions using AND ($and$), OR ($or$), and NOT ($overline(x)$).

This led us to:
- DNF and CNF (canonical forms)
- K-maps and Quine-McCluskey (minimization)
- Circuit design with standard gates

#Block(color: blue)[
  *Question:* Can we represent Boolean functions using only AND ($and$) and XOR ($xor$)?

  That is, without OR and NOT operations?
]

The answer is yes, and this leads to a completely different algebraic structure with important theoretical and practical applications.

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Why ANF matters:*
  - *Cryptography:* Analyze security of encryption algorithms (AES S-boxes)
  - *Coding theory:* Design error-correcting codes (Reed-Muller codes)
  - *Formal verification:* Unique canonical form simplifies equivalence checking
  - *Quantum computing:* XOR gates are easier to implement than OR gates
]

== Introducing Algebraic Normal Form

#definition[
  An _Algebraic Normal Form_ (ANF), also called a _Zhegalkin polynomial_, represents a Boolean function as a polynomial over $FF_2$ (the field {0, 1}) using:
  - XOR ($xor$) for addition (modulo 2)
  - AND ($and$) for multiplication
  - Constants 0 and 1
]

#example[
  The function $f(x, y, z) = x y xor x z xor y z xor x xor 1$ is in ANF.

  Term structure:
  - $x y$, $x z$, $y z$ are degree-2 terms (quadratic)
  - $x$ is a degree-1 term (linear)
  - $1$ is a degree-0 term (constant)

  The algebraic degree of this function is 2.
]

#note(title: "Notation")[
  We write XOR as $xor$ or $+$, and AND as $and$, $dot$, or by juxtaposition ($x y$).

#note[
  In $FF_2$, XOR corresponds to addition and AND to multiplication. \
  ANF treats Boolean functions as polynomials over this field.
]

== ANF Structure

#example[
  The function $f(x, y, z) = x y xor x z xor y z xor x xor 1$ is in ANF.

  Terms:
  - $x y$ --- degree 2 (product of 2 variables)
  - $x z$ --- degree 2
  - $y z$ --- degree 2
  - $x$ --- degree 1 (linear term)
  - $1$ --- degree 0 (constant)

  The function has algebraic degree 2.
]

#note[
  In ANF, we write addition (XOR) as $xor$ or simply $+$.

  Multiplication (AND) can be written as $and$, $dot$, or juxtaposition (e.g., $x y$).
]

// #Block(color: orange)[
//   *Key observation:* The self-inverse property $(x xor x = 0)$ fundamentally distinguishes ANF from DNF, leading to different algebraic structures and applications.
// ]

== Uniqueness of ANF Representation

#theorem[
  Every Boolean function $f: {0,1}^n to {0,1}$ has _exactly one_ ANF representation.
]

#proof[
  Consider Boolean functions as a vector space over $FF_2$:

  + There are $2^(2^n)$ Boolean functions on $n$ variables
  + There are $2^n$ possible monomials, giving $2^(2^n)$ possible ANFs
  + The mapping $"ANF" to "Boolean function"$ is a linear bijection over $FF_2$

  Therefore, each function has exactly one ANF representation.
]

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Significance:* Unlike DNF/CNF (which have multiple equivalent forms), ANF is always canonical.

  This eliminates the need for minimization in the ANF context.
]

#note[
  The uniqueness follows from the linear algebra structure over $FF_2$. \
  The Möbius transform (used in Pascal's triangle method) provides an explicit bijection.
]

== Monomials in ANF

#example[
  For $n = 3$ variables $(x, y, z)$:

  #align(center)[
    #table(
      columns: 3,
      stroke: (x, y) => if y == 0 { (bottom: 0.8pt) },
      table.header([*Degree*], [*Count*], [*Monomials*]),
      [0], [1], [$1$],
      [1], [3], [$x, y, z$],
      [2], [3], [$x y, x z, y z$],
      [3], [1], [$x y z$],
    )
  ]

  Total: $2^3 = 8$ possible monomials (including constant 1).

  Each monomial either appears in ANF or doesn't → $2^8 = 256$ possible ANFs for 3 variables.
]

#note[
  For $n$ variables, there are $sum_(k=0)^n binom(n, k) = 2^n$ possible monomials.
]

== Algebraic Degree

#definition[
  The _algebraic degree_ of a Boolean function in ANF is the maximum number of variables in any monomial with coefficient 1.
]

#example[
  #table(
    columns: 3,
    align: (left, left, center),
    stroke: (x, y) => if y == 0 { (bottom: 0.8pt) },
    table.header([*Function*], [*ANF*], [*Degree*]),
    [NOT], [$f(x) = x xor 1$], [1],

    [Full ANF], [$f(x,y,z) = x y z xor x y xor dots.h xor 1$], [3],
  )
]

== Why Algebraic Degree Matters

*Application:* Cryptography and security

In encryption systems, functions transform data to hide it from attackers.
The algebraic degree determines how _complex_ these transformations are.

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Key insight:* Low-degree functions can be broken using linear algebra!

  If a function has degree 2-3, an attacker can:
  1. Express it as ANF (polynomial over $FF_2$)
  2. Treat each product term (like $x y z$) as a _new variable_
  3. Solve the resulting _linear_ system of equations

  This is called *linearization attack*.
]

== Example: Breaking a Low-Degree Function

#example[
  Suppose an encryption system uses $f(x, y, z) = x xor y z$ (degree 2).

  *Linearization attack:*
  - *Step 1:* ANF has nonlinear term $y z$ $=>$ introduce variable $w = y z$
  - *Step 2:* Rewrite as $f = x xor w$ $=>$ now linear in $x, w$!
  - *Step 3:* Collect pairs $(x_i, y_i, z_i) maps f_i$ $=>$ equations $x_i xor w_i = f_i$ where $w_i = y_i z_i$
  - *Step 4:* Solve linear system over $FF_2$ $=>$ recover secret values $=>$ encryption broken!

  *Why it works:* Only 1 nonlinear term $=>$ only 1 new variable $=>$ system stays small and solvable.
]

#Block(color: orange)[
  *Defense:* High-degree function (7-8) has many nonlinear terms $=>$ too many new variables $=>$ system becomes huge and unsolvable.
]

== Degree in Real Encryption Systems

#Block(color: green)[
  *Why encryption functions need high degree:*

  Modern encryption (like AES, used in HTTPS, WiFi, banking) uses special functions called _S-boxes_.
  These are Boolean functions $FF_2^8 to FF_2^8$ (8 input bits $to$ 8 output bits).

  *Design requirement:* Degree must be close to maximum!
  - Maximum possible degree for 8 variables: 8
  - But degree-8 has special mathematical structure (too predictable)
  - *AES uses degree 7* --- highest practical degree

  If degree were 2-3, attackers could solve the system and break encryption.
]

#Block(color: teal)[
  *Historical context:* Older encryption (DES, 1970s) used degree 6. Later discovered vulnerable to algebraic attacks. Modern systems learned from this mistake.
]

== Methods for Computing ANF

We will examine three methods for computing ANF from truth tables:

#align(center)[
  #table(
    columns: 5,
    align: (left, center, center, center, left),
    stroke: (x, y) => if y == 0 { (bottom: 0.8pt) },
    table.header([*Method*], [*Complexity*], [*Variables*], [*Difficulty*], [*Best suited for*]),
    [Direct computation], [$O(2^(2n))$], [1-3], [High], [Theoretical understanding],
    [Pascal's triangle], [$O(2^n)$], [1-5], [Medium], [Hand calculations],
    [Karnaugh map], [$O(2^n)$], [2-4], [Low], [Visual intuition],
  )
]

#Block(color: blue)[
  *Learning approach:*
  + Begin with K-map method (most intuitive)
  + Master Pascal's triangle (most practical)
  + Understand direct method (theoretical foundation)
]

Each method provides different insights into the structure of ANF.

== Method 1: Direct Computation

#Block(color: teal)[
  *Idea:* Solve a system of linear equations over $FF_2$ (arithmetic mod 2).
]

For function $f: FF_2^n to FF_2$, we want to find coefficients $a_S$ such that:
$
  f(x_1, ..., x_n) = xor.big_(S subset.eq {1,...,n}) (a_S product_(i in S) x_i)
$

where $xor$ denotes XOR and $product$ denotes AND.

Each row of the truth table gives one linear equation!

#Block(color: orange)[
  *Remember:* In $FF_2$, addition is XOR:
  - $1 xor 1 = 0 xor 0 = 0$
  - $1 xor 0 = 0 xor 1 = 1$
]

== Direct Computation: Example (Setup)

#example[
  Find ANF for $f(x, y)$ with truth table:

  #align(center)[
    #table(
      columns: 3,
      stroke: (x, y) => if y == 0 { (bottom: 0.8pt) },
      table.header([$x$], [$y$], [$f(x,y)$]),
      [0], [0], [1],
      [0], [1], [1],
      [1], [0], [1],
      [1], [1], [0],
    )
  ]
]

Let ANF be: $f(x, y) = a_0 xor a_1 x xor a_2 y xor a_3 x y$

From truth table, substitute each $(x, y)$ to get 4 equations over $FF_2$:

#align(center)[
  #table(
    columns: 4,
    align: (center, left, center, center),
    stroke: (x, y) => if y == 0 { (bottom: 0.8pt) },
    table.header([*$(x,y)$*], [*Substituted equation*], [], [*$f$*]),
    [(0,0)], [$a_0 xor (a_1 dot 0) xor (a_2 dot 0) xor (a_3 dot 0 dot 0) = a_0$], [$=$], [1],
    [(0,1)], [$a_0 xor (a_1 dot 0) xor (a_2 dot 1) xor (a_3 dot 0 dot 1) = a_0 xor a_2$], [$=$], [1],
    [(1,0)], [$a_0 xor (a_1 dot 1) xor (a_2 dot 0) xor (a_3 dot 1 dot 0) = a_0 xor a_1$], [$=$], [1],
    [(1,1)], [$a_0 xor a_1 xor a_2 xor a_3$], [$=$], [0],
  )
]

== Direct Computation: Solution

*Solving the system step-by-step:*
- Equation 1: $a_0 = 1$
- Equation 2: $(a_0 xor a_2 = 1) => (1 xor a_2 = 1) => a_2 = 0$
- Equation 3: $(a_0 xor a_1 = 1) => (1 xor a_1 = 1) => a_1 = 0$
- Equation 4: $(1 xor 0 xor 0 xor a_3 = 0) => (1 xor a_3 = 0) => a_3 = 1$

*Result:*~ $f(x, y) = 1 xor x y$, which is equivalent to $f = x nand y$.

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Key insight:* Each row in the truth table gives exactly one linear equation over $FF_2$.
  - With $n$ variables, we get $2^n$ equations in $2^n$ unknowns (the ANF coefficients)
  - The system is always solvable (ANF exists and is unique)
  - But for $n > 4$, solving $2^n$ equations manually becomes impractical!
]

== Method 2: Pascal's Triangle Method

#Block[
  *Fast systematic method* using a butterfly/pyramid pattern!
]

*Algorithm:*
+ Write function values $f$ in a column (in binary order: 000, 001, 010, ...)
+ Create next column: XOR each adjacent pair $(f_i xor f_(i+1))$
+ Repeat step 2 until only one value remains
+ The *first value* of each column is an ANF coefficient

#note[
  Also called the _Butterfly method_ or _ANF transform_.
]

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Pattern:* Coefficients appear in binary order: $1$, $z$, $y$, $y z$, $x$, $x z$, $x y$, $x y z$
]

== Pascal's Triangle Method: Example

Find ANF for $f(x, y, z) = sum m(0, 1, 3, 7)$:

#align(center)[
  #let bb(it) = {
    box(stroke: red, outset: 3pt, radius: 2pt)[#it]
  }
  #table(
    columns: 10,
    stroke: (x, y) => if y == 0 { (bottom: 0.8pt) } + if x == 1 { (right: 0.8pt) },
    table.header(
      [$x y z$], [$f$], [$a_1$], [$a_z$], [$a_y$], [$a_(y z)$], [$a_x$], [$a_(x z)$], [$a_(x y)$], [$a_(x y z)$]
    ),
    [000], [1], bb[1], [0], bb[1], bb[1], bb[1], [0], bb[1], [0],
    [001], [1], [1], [1], [0], [0], [1], [1], [1], [ ],
    [010], [0], [0], [1], [0], [1], [0], [0], [ ], [ ],
    [011], [1], [1], [1], [1], [1], [0], [ ], [ ], [ ],
    [100], [0], [0], [0], [0], [1], [ ], [ ], [ ], [ ],
    [101], [0], [0], [0], [1], [ ], [ ], [ ], [ ], [ ],
    [110], [0], [0], [1], [ ], [ ], [ ], [ ], [ ], [ ],
    [111], [1], [1], [ ], [ ], [ ], [ ], [ ], [ ], [ ],
  )
]

*ANF:*~ $f = 1 xor y xor y z xor x xor x y$

== Pascal's Triangle: Why It Works

The transformation computes the _Möbius transform_ over the Boolean lattice:

$ a_S = xor.big_(T subset.eq S) f(T) $

Each coefficient $a_S$ is the XOR of all function values $f(T)$ where $T subset.eq S$.

#example[
  For $a_(x y)$, corresponding to input 110 = ${x, y}$:
  $
    a_(x y) & = f(000) xor f(010) xor f(100) xor f(110) \
            & = 1 xor 0 xor 0 xor 0 = 1
  $

== Method 3: Karnaugh Map Method

#Block(color: blue)[
  Use K-map regions to identify monomials in ANF.
]

*Algorithm:*
+ Fill K-map with function values
+ For each possible monomial:
  - Identify its rectangular region in the K-map
  - If the top-left cell equals 1, include the monomial
+ Combine all selected monomials using XOR

#Block(color: orange)[
  *Key differences from minimization:*
  - Check _all_ rectangular regions, not just maximal ones
  - Combine terms with XOR instead of OR

== Converting Between ANF and DNF

Two approaches for converting between representations:

]

#Block(color: yellow)[

]

#note[
  Direct algebraic conversion requires expanding $x xor y = (x and overline(y)) or (overline(x) and y)$, which becomes complex for multi-variable functions.
]

== Converting ANF to DNF

#example[
  Convert $f = x xor y xor x y$ (ANF) to DNF
]

*Step 1:* Build truth table by evaluating ANF:

#align(center)[
  #v(-.5em)
  #table(
    columns: 4,
    stroke: (x, y) => if y == 0 { (bottom: 0.8pt) },
    table.header([$x$], [$y$], [$f = x xor y xor x y$], [*Minterm*]),
    [0], [0], [$0 xor 0 xor 0 = 0$], [---],
    [0], [1], [$0 xor 1 xor 0 = 1$], [$overline(x) y$],
    [1], [0], [$1 xor 0 xor 0 = 1$], [$x overline(y)$],
    [1], [1], [$1 xor 1 xor 1 = 1$], [$x y$],
  )
]

*Step 2:* Read minterms where $f = 1$:

*DNF:* $f = overline(x) y or x overline(y) or x y = sum m(1, 2, 3)$

== Converting DNF to ANF

#example[
  Convert $f = overline(x) y or x overline(y)$ ~(DNF) to ANF
]

*Step 1:* Build truth table by evaluating DNF

*Step 2:* Apply Pascal's triangle method to get ANF:

#align(center)[
  #let bb(it) = {
    box(stroke: red, outset: 3pt, radius: 2pt)[#it]
  }
  #table(
    columns: 6,
    stroke: (x, y) => if y == 0 { (bottom: 0.8pt) } + if x == 1 { (right: 0.8pt) },
    table.header([$x y$], [$f$], [$a_1$], [$a_x$], [$a_y$], [$a_(x y)$]),
    [00], [0], [0], bb[1], bb[1], [0],
    [01], [1], [1], [0], [1], [ ],
    [10], [1], [1], [1], [ ], [ ],
    [11], [0], [0], [ ], [ ], [ ],

*ANF:* $f = x xor y$ ~(the XOR function!)

]


= Functional Completeness
#focus-slide()

== The Fundamental Question

We've seen many Boolean operations: AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR, implication, equivalence...

#Block(color: purple)[
  *The million-dollar question:*

  Imagine you're designing a new computer chip.
  Manufacturing costs depend on how many _different types_ of gates you need.
  Each gate type requires different masks, testing procedures, and inventory.

  *Question:* What's the _minimum_ set of operations needed to build _everything_?

  Can we manufacture chips with just ONE type of gate?
  Or do we absolutely need three types (AND, OR, NOT)?

  This isn't just theoretical --- Intel, AMD, and ARM face this question for every new processor!
]

*Central question:* Which sets of operations can express _every_ Boolean function?

For example:
- Can we build everything using only ${and, or, not}$? #YES
- Can we build everything using only ${"NAND"}$? #YES (just one gate type!)
- Can we build everything using only ${and, or}$? #NO (can't make NOT)
- Can we build everything using only ${xor}$? #NO (only linear functions)

#note[
  *Post's theorem (1941):* There are exactly FIVE "weaknesses" a set can have. If a set avoids all five, it's functionally complete. Having even one weakness means some functions cannot be expressed.
]

== Functional Closure

#definition[
  Let $F$ be a set of Boolean functions.
  The _functional closure_ $[F]$ is the smallest set containing $F$ and closed under:
  + *Composition:* If $f, g in [F]$, then $h(x) = f(g(x)) in [F]$
  + *Identification:* If $f(x_1, ..., x_n) in [F]$, then $f(x, x, x_3, ..., x_n) in [F]$
  + *Permutation:* If $f(x_1, ..., x_n) in [F]$, then $f(x_(sigma(1)), ..., x_(sigma(n))) in [F]$ for any permutation $sigma$
  + *Introduction of fictitious variables:* If $f(x_1, ..., x_n) in [F]$, then $f(x_1, ..., x_n, x_(n+1)) in [F]$
]

Informally, $[F]$ contains all functions you can build by _combining_ functions from $F$.

#note[
  The closure operations keep the important structure while allowing you combine functions freely.
]

== Functional Completeness

#definition[
  A set $F$ of Boolean functions is _functionally complete_ (or _universal_) if its closure $[F]$ contains all possible Boolean functions.

  Equivalently: every Boolean function can be expressed using only operations from $F$.
]

#example[
  *Complete sets:*
  - ${and, or, not}$ --- the classical basis
  - ${and, not}$ --- AND with negation
  - ${or, not}$ --- OR with negation
  - ${"NAND"}$ --- NAND alone (Sheffer stroke)
  - ${"NOR"}$ --- NOR alone (Peirce arrow)

  *Incomplete sets:*
  - ${and, or}$ --- cannot produce NOT
  - ${xor}$ --- only produces linear functions
  - ${not}$ --- only produces constants and negations
]

#grid(
  columns: (1fr, 1fr),

  [
    *Circuit Design*

    Functionally complete sets determine which gates are sufficient to build any digital circuit.

    #note[
      NAND and NOR gates are universal --- entire processors can be built using only NAND gates!
    ]
  ],
  [
    *Programming Languages*

    Programming languages must provide functionally complete sets of operators.

    #example[
      C provides: `&&`, `||`, `!`, `^` \
      Each subset {`&&`, `!`} or {`||`, `!`} is complete.
    ]
  ],
)

#note[
  *Practical constraint:* Manufacturing circuits with a single gate type (NAND or NOR) simplifies design, testing, and production.
]

== Post's Five Classes

#definition[
  A Boolean function $f: {0,1}^n to {0,1}$ belongs to class:

  + *$T_0$ (preserves 0):* $f(0, 0, ..., 0) = 0$
  + *$T_1$ (preserves 1):* $f(1, 1, ..., 1) = 1$
  + *$S$ (self-dual):* $f(overline(x)_1, ..., overline(x)_n) = overline(f(x_1, ..., x_n))$
  + *$M$ (monotone):* $x <= y => f(x) <= f(y)$ ~(bitwise comparison)
  + *$L$ (linear):* $f$ has ANF of degree $<= 1$ ~(no AND terms)
]

#note[
  These classes are _closed under composition_: combining functions from a class stays within that class.
  If all operations in $F$ belong to one class, $[F]$ cannot contain all Boolean functions.
]

  ],
)

#note[
  Each class is closed under composition. If $F subset.eq C$ for some class $C$, then $[F] subset.eq C$, preventing completeness.
]

== Post's Criterion

#theorem[
  A set $F$ of Boolean functions is functionally complete if and only if $F$ contains at least one function that does _not_ belong to each of the five Post classes:

  $
    F "is complete" <==> cases(
      exists f in F : f in.not T_0,
      exists f in F : f in.not T_1,
      exists f in F : f in.not S,
      exists f in F : f in.not M,
      exists f in F : f in.not L
    )
  $

  #note[
    Each $f$ can be different, or the _same_ function can escape multiple classes.
  ]
]

Equivalently: $F$ is complete $iff$ $F$ is not contained in any Post class.

#note[
  *Practical test:* To prove $F$ is complete, find five functions (possibly the same) escaping each class.
]

== Post's Criterion: Intuition

Each Post class represents a "weakness":
- *$T_0$:* Cannot create constant 1 from all-0 input
- *$T_1$:* Cannot create constant 0 from all-1 input
- *$S$:* Cannot break symmetry between $x$ and $overline(x)$
- *$M$:* Cannot decrease output when input increases
- *$L$:* Cannot create nonlinear interactions (AND-like)

Escaping all five weaknesses provides power to build any function.

== Post's Criterion: Proof Sketch

The full proof is technical, but the key steps are:

*Step 1:* Show that if $F subset.eq T_0$, then $[F] subset.eq T_0$ ~(similarly for $T_1, S, M, L$).

*Proof:* Composition preserves each class. For example, if $f, g in T_0$, then:
$
  h(0, ..., 0) = f(g(0, ..., 0), ...) = f(0, ..., 0) = 0
$

*Step 2:* If $F$ escapes all five classes, construct ${and, not}$ from $F$.

This involves:
- Using non-$T_0$ and non-$T_1$ to create constants
- Using non-$S$ to break self-duality
- Using non-$M$ to enable decreasing behavior
- Using non-$L$ to create nonlinear terms

*Step 3:* Since ${and, not}$ is complete, $[F]$ contains all functions. $qed$

== Verifying Completeness: Positive Examples

#example[
  *Is ${and, or, not}$ complete?*

  Check each class:
  - NOT $in.not T_0$: NOT(0) = 1 ≠ 0 #YES
  - NOT $in.not T_1$: NOT(1) = 0 ≠ 1 #YES
  - AND $in.not S$: non-self-dual #YES
  - NOT $in.not M$: NOT is not monotone #YES
  - AND $in.not L$: AND has degree 2 #YES

  *Conclusion:* Complete! #YES

== Universal Gates: The Ultimate Minimalism

#Block(color: teal)[
  *The manufacturing dream:*

  In the early days of computing (1950s-60s), every different gate type required:
  - Different design specifications
  - Different testing procedures
  - Different inventory management
  - Different failure modes to diagnose

  Engineers wondered: "What if we could build EVERYTHING with just ONE gate type?"

  *The answer:* NAND and NOR are _universal_ --- you can build any circuit using only NAND gates (or only NOR gates)!

  This revolutionized chip manufacturing.
  Today, while modern chips use mixed gates for optimization, the NAND-only design philosophy still influences architecture.
]

#theorem[
  NAND and NOR gates are _functionally complete_ --- any Boolean function can be implemented using only NAND gates (or only NOR gates).
]

#example[Building the basic gates from NAND (the "construction kit")][
  Starting with ONLY the NAND gate, we can build everything:

  *Step 1 --- Build NOT:*
  $overline(A) = A nand A$ #h(2em) "NAND a signal with itself to invert it"

  *Step 2 --- Build AND:*
  $A and B = overline(A nand B) = (A nand B) nand (A nand B)$ \
  "Do NAND, then invert the result with another NAND"

  *Step 3 --- Build OR:*
  $A or B = overline(A) nand overline(B) = (A nand A) nand (B nand B)$ \
  "Invert both inputs, then NAND them" (De Morgan's law in action!)

  *Step 4 --- Build anything:*
  Since ${and, or, not}$ is complete, and we can build all three from NAND, we're done! #text(green)[✓]
]

#Block(color: blue)[
  *Why this matters in practice:*
  - *Modern FPGA chips:* Built primarily from lookup tables (LUTs) that can implement any function
  - *ASIC design:* Standard cell libraries often emphasize NAND/NOR for uniformity
  - *Fault testing:* Easier to test one gate type comprehensively
  - *Academic value:* Proves minimality --- you can't do better than one operation!
]

#note[
  In reality, modern chip designers use mixed gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etc.) because:
  - Lower power consumption
  - Faster operation (fewer gate delays)
  - Smaller area (1 AND gate vs. 2 NANDs)

  But NAND-only designs prove what's _possible_ and provide fallback when needed!
]

== Constructing Circuits from Boolean Expressions

*General procedure:*

+ *Start with Boolean expression:* Obtain from truth table (DNF/CNF) or specifications
+ *Minimize if desired:* Use K-maps, Quine-McCluskey, or algebraic methods
+ *Identify gate structure:* Break expression into hierarchical operations
+ *Draw circuit:* Connect gates according to expression structure
+ *Verify:* Check truth table matches specification

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Key principle:* Expression evaluation order determines circuit topology (depth and gates).
]

== Circuit Construction: Example

#example[
  Build circuit for $f(A, B, C) = A and B or overline(A) and C$
]

*Step 1:* Identify operations:
- Two AND gates: $A and B$ and $overline(A) and C$
- One NOT gate: $overline(A)$
- One OR gate: combining the AND results

*Step 2:* Determine levels:
+ Level 0 (inputs): $A, B, C$
+ Level 1: $overline(A)$ ~(NOT gate)
+ Level 2: $A and B$ and $overline(A) and C$ ~(AND gates)
+ Level 3: Final OR gate

*Circuit depth:* 3 levels (excluding inputs)

#note[
  Depth affects propagation delay --- critical for circuit speed.
]

== Circuit Minimization Goals

Now that we've seen various combinational circuits, let's consider: *How do we make them efficient?*

*Minimization objectives:*

+ *Gate count:* Fewer gates $=>$ lower cost, smaller chip area
+ *Circuit depth:* Fewer levels $=>$ faster operation (less delay)
+ *Fanout:* Number of gates driven by one output (affects loading)
+ *Power consumption:* Fewer transitions $=>$ less energy

#note[
  These objectives often conflict! Minimization requires trade-offs.
]

#example[
  DNF for $f = A B or A C or B C$ (3 terms, 3 gates):
  - Algebraic identity: $A B or A C or B C = A B or A C$ when $A = 1$
  - But for all cases, adding redundant term $B C$ eliminates hazards!
  - *Trade-off:* More gates for reliable behavior

]

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *To build real computers, we need circuits that "remember"!*

  This needs a completely different approach than what we've seen so far.
]

== Combinational vs Sequential Circuits

#definition[
  A _sequential circuit_ has outputs that depend on:
  + Current inputs (like combinational circuits)
  + *Previous state* (memory)

  This requires _feedback_ --- outputs feed back to inputs.
]

#example[
  - *Combinational:* ALU, multiplexer, decoder (no memory)
  - *Sequential:* Registers, counters, state machines (with memory)
]

#note[
  Truth tables don't work for sequential circuits --- we need _state diagrams_ or _state tables_ instead.
]

== Latches: Basic Memory Elements

#definition[
  A _latch_ is a bistable circuit with two stable states, used to store one bit.
]

#example[SR Latch (Set-Reset)][

  *Inputs:* $S$ (set), $R$ (reset)

  *Outputs:* $Q$ (state), $overline(Q)$ (complementary)

  *Behavior:*
  - $S = 1, R = 0$: Set $Q = 1$
  - $S = 0, R = 1$: Reset $Q = 0$
  - $S = 0, R = 0$: Hold current state (memory!)
  - $S = 1, R = 1$: *Forbidden* (both outputs would be 0)

  *Implementation:* Two cross-coupled NOR gates (or NAND gates)
]

#Block(color: orange)[
  *Warning:* SR latch has a forbidden state $(S=1, R=1)$ that must be avoided by circuit design.

  ],
)

]

== Why Truth Tables Fail for Sequential Circuits

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Key insight:* An SR latch cannot be described by a simple Boolean function $Q = f(S, R)$ because it depends on _previous state_.
]

#place(right)[
  #set align(left)
  #Block(color: yellow)[
    *Sequential circuits need:*
    - State tables (not truth tables)
    - Finite state machines (FSMs)
    - Temporal logic (next-state functions)
    - Timing diagrams showing state transitions
  ]
]

*Why not?* The output $Q$ depends on:
- Current inputs $S, R$
- *Previous output* $Q_t$ (feedback)

This is a _state-dependent_ behavior:
- $(S, R) = (0, 0)$ with $Q_t = 0 => Q_(t+1) = 0$
- $(S, R) = (0, 0)$ with $Q_t = 1 => Q_(t+1) = 1$

Same inputs, different outputs! This violates the basic idea of a function.

#Block(color: purple)[
  *Bottom line:* Pure Boolean functions can only describe _combinational_ logic.
]

== Flip-Flops: Clocked Memory

#definition[
  A _flip-flop_ is an edge-triggered memory element that changes state only on clock transitions (rising or falling edge).
]

#Block(color: blue)[
  *Key difference from latches:*
  - *Latches:* Level-sensitive (transparent when enabled)
  - *Flip-flops:* Edge-triggered (change only on clock edge)

  Flip-flops are more predictable and easier to synchronize in complex systems.
]

== D Flip-Flop

#example[D (Data) Flip-Flop][
  *Input:* $D$ (data), $"CLK"$ (clock),~ *Output:* $Q$

  *Behavior:*
  - On clock edge (e.g., rising edge $arrow.t$):~ $Q_(t+1) = D_t$ ~(capture and store $D$ value)
  - Between clock edges: $Q$ holds value (ignores $D$ changes)

  *Characteristic equation:* $Q_(t+1) = D$

  ],
)

#note[
  In practice, however, most designs use _D flip-flops_ because they're _simpler_ and more _predictable_.
]

== Clock Signals and Synchronization

#definition[
  A _clock signal_ is a periodic square wave that synchronizes state changes across a sequential circuit.
]

*Key clock parameters:*
- *Frequency:* Clock cycles per second (Hz)
- *Period:* Time for one complete cycle
- *Duty cycle:* Fraction of period when clock is HIGH
- *Rising edge* ($arrow.t$) or *Falling edge* ($arrow.b$): Transition points

#Block(color: yellow)[
  *Synchronous design:* All flip-flops share the same clock signal, so state updates happen together.

  *Asynchronous design:* No global clock (timing analysis is much harder).
]

#note[
  Most digital systems use _synchronous_ design because it's more predictable and _easier to verify_.
]

== Real Circuit Issues: Hazards

#definition[
  A _hazard_ (or _glitch_) is an unwanted transient change in circuit output due to:
  - Unequal propagation delays in different paths
  - Race conditions between signals
]

        #k-mapper.karnaugh(
          8,
          y-label: $A B$,
          x-label: move(dy: .5em, $C$),
          manual-terms: (
            kcell(0, 0),
            kcell(1, 0),
            kcell(2, 1),
            kcell(3, 1),

      ]

      Now the transition is covered by the new rectangle.
    ],
  )

  - Expected: $f$ stays 1 (both terms can be 1)
  - Actual (without fix): Brief glitch to 0 if delays differ
  - Solution: Redundant term eliminates the gap
]

#Block(color: orange)[
  *Types of hazards:*
  - *Static hazards:* Output should stay constant but glitches
  - *Dynamic hazards:* Multiple transitions during single input change
]

== Race Conditions and Metastability

#definition[
  A _race condition_ occurs when circuit behavior depends on the relative timing of multiple signals, leading to unpredictable outcomes.
]

#definition[
  _Metastability_ occurs when a flip-flop input changes too close to the clock edge, causing the output to hover in an undefined state before settling.
]

#note[
  *Timing constraints:* Setup time ($t_"setup"$): input stable before clock; Hold time ($t_"hold"$): input stable after clock. Violating these causes metastability. Proper synchronizer design (multi-stage flip-flops) reduces risk.
]

== Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) Overview

#definition[
  An _Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)_ is a combinational circuit that performs arithmetic and logical operations on integer operands.
]

*Typical ALU operations:*

#grid(
  columns: 2,
  gutter: 1em,
  [
    *Arithmetic:*
    - Addition, Subtraction
    - Increment, Decrement
    - Multiplication (in some ALUs)

  [
    *Logical:*
    - AND, OR, XOR, NOT
    - Shift left, Shift right
    - Rotate operations
    - Bit manipulation
